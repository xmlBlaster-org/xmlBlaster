	CSharp (C#) Access to XmlBlaster using XML-RPC Protocol

Note:

	All compiled stuff (exe and lib) are for windows.
	I hope one day someone will add C# compiled stuff for other platforms.

	You can run directly them, without need to compile the demos sources.

Folders :

	./bin : the executable demo
		it was compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio .Net 2003 on Windows XP.
	./lib : the xml-rpc library for C# from http://www.xml-rpc.net/
		and others stuff.
	./src : sources files for demos (C# and graphics).
	./VisualStudioNet2003 : projects files

	I hope to get time soon for creating projects file for the fabulous SharpDevelop IDE.

Running the demo :

	At first start a XmlBlaster's server:

	Dos command lines :
   > set XMLBLASTER_HOME=D:\xmlBlaster_REL_1_0_7\xmlBlaster
   > java -cp %XMLBLASTER_HOME%/lib -jar %XMLBLASTER_HOME%/lib/xmlBlaster.jar

	CSharpDrawingDemo demo:

	from the bin folder,
	Start two CSharpDrawingDemo.exe
	Set the right server url in both and one different username for each instance.
	Click connect button on both, then start drawing.

	XmlBlasterMessagesManager demo:

	from the bin folder,
	Start XmlBlasterMessagesManager.exe
	then click on connect.
	This demo is more a usefull tool to see messages.

	If you run XmlBlasterMessagesManager.exe when CSharpDrawingDemo.exe is running,
	you will see all drawing messages.

Note about XmlBlasterLib

	It is under development. For instant, only XmlBlasterMessagesManager is using it.
	I should to update CSharpDrawingDemo to use that library.
	Feel free to give some time on that job ;o)

Note about sources

	Sorry, sometimes comment are in english, but often in french ...
	It's depends of the time (morning, afternoon or night !).
	Feel free to add english comments ;o)
