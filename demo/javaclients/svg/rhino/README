Please read
  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.javascript.rhino.html
first.

This is a demo which shows the possibilities of xmlBlaster when
combining it with javascript (using the rhino LiveConnect feature)
and with SVG. It has currently been tested with the batik browser
but it should also work with Mozilla (with native svg).

How to use it:
1) start a session of the xmlBlaster server (the chessRhino.svg is
configured for the localhost. If you use an other host, please 
change chessRhino.svg) by invoking
java org.xmlBlaster.Main

2) On another terminal start the svgbrowser from batik by invoking
   
   java -Djava.security.policy=${XMLBLASTER_HOME}/config/xmlBlaster.policy 
        org.apache.batik.apps.svgbrowser.Main
        $XMLBLASTER_HOME/demo/javaclients/svg/rhino/chessRhino.svg

This loads already the chess game.
Assure to load our relaxed xmlBlaster.policy to avoid 'access denied' exceptions

3) start another svgbrowser on another terminal as you did in 2) and then you can start
to play chess.


To test the performance you can start another client which randomly moves around the chess
pieces. This can be done by invoking:

java javaclients.svg.rhino.ChessMover -interval 30

where 30 here would be the number of milliseconds the application waits between 
the movement of each piece.


Enjoy
