INTRO
=====

This is a simple example-setup where cluster nodes communicate over EMAIL with each others.
This is typically the case between two different companies which have closed firewalls
or for a security gateway using the SMTP protocol.

Please read the cluster requirement and the email requirement first:
  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/cluster.html
  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/protocol.email.html


SETUP
=====

To run this example you need to setup a mail transfer agent (MTA) or (mis)use for example your email provider.

Here we assume a MTA running on localhost, the port for SMTP is moved from 25 to 8025
and the port for POP3 is moved from 110 to port 8110 to avoid conflicts with other systems
on your PC and to avoid root priviliges on Unix machines.

The examples are run with james.apache.org.

Please follow the guidelines in
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/protocol.email.html
to install, configure and start james.

If your MTA runs on another machine or another port, please adjust 'plugins.xml' accordingly.


RUN IT
======

1. Start james

2. Start cluster nodes 'heron' and 'golan'
   
   You NEED to start the xmlBlaster cluster nodes in the directory
      xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/cluster/email
   to find the configuration files (or use absolute pathes)!

   Start cluster node 'golan', which is a slave on domain='greenwood' (that is messages or commands marked with such a domain).
   Other routings can be configured in golan.properties and heron.properties.
   Please read http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/cluster.html for more details

     cd xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/cluster/email
     java -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote org.xmlBlaster.Main -propertyFile golan.properties -pluginsFile plugins.xml

   You can use the JMX 'jconsole' GUI application if you want to have more control over golan.

   Start the cluster node 'heron'

     cd xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/cluster/email
     java -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote org.xmlBlaster.Main -propertyFile heron.properties -pluginsFile plugins.xml

3. Start a subscriber

   A subscriber connects to 'golan' (the slave of topic "Woodlogging").
   The subscription is automatically forworded to 'heron' (the master of this topic) as we have
   marked the subscription domain with 'greenwood'

     java javaclients.HelloWorldSubscribe -oid Woodlogging -domain greenwood -session.name SUBSCRIBER/1 -persistentSubscribe true -dispatch/callback/retries -1 

4. Start a sniffer to see what happens (optional):

     java javaclients.simplereader.SimpleReaderGui -dispatch/connection/plugin/socket/port 7700

5. Start a publisher and hit enter to publish

   A publisher connects to 'heron' and publishes messages to topic "Woodlogging"

     java javaclients.HelloWorldPublish -oid Woodlogging -domain greenwood -session.name PUBLISHER/1 -numPublish 100 -dispatch/connection/plugin/socket/port 7700


The messages are published from the publish client to 'heron', and are forwarded to 'golan' and from there directed to the subsciber.
The clients connect with the default SOCKET protocol, but 'heron' and 'golan' communicate over email.
This communication is fail save, if any of the participants is crashing or down no message will be lost.

NOTE 1: You HAVE TO start all examples in the current directory
   xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/cluster/email
   to assure the plugins.xml and *.properties files are found.
   Alternatively pass the property names with full path.

NOTE 2: Assure that plugins.xml has the plugin 'cluster' configured
   with the create='true' attribute (this is the default setting)

NOTE 3: You can switch on specific logging to get a better idea what
   happens, typically this is a good choice:
   -logging/org.xmlBlaster.engine.RequestBroker FINE -logging/org.xmlBlaster.engine.cluster FINE -logging/org.xmlBlaster.client FINE

NOTE 4: You need an email provider up and running, you can use 'james.apache.org' to start with:
   ~/james-2.2.0/bin> ./run.sh
   This provider needs to use
      POP3 Service started plain:8110
      SMTP Service started plain:8025
   or you need to adjust the IP and PORT in xmlBlasterPlugins.xml (here called plugins.xml).
   
   telnet localhost 4555
      and add user golan and user heron to the MTA.
