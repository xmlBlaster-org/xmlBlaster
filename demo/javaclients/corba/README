We have provided ClientRaw.java if you wish to study the raw CORBA access.

Another source to see how CORBA access is implemented, see files in
 xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/client/protocol/corba


1. Example using a file to pass the server IOR:

   Start xmlBlaster server:

      java org.xmlBlaster.Main -plugin/ior/iorFile /tmp/NS_Ref


   Start the client:

      jaco javaclients.corba.ClientRaw -dispatch/connection/plugin/ior/iorFile /tmp/NS_Ref


   To get some more logging infos try:

      jaco javaclients.corba.ClientRaw -dispatch/connection/plugin/ior/iorFile /tmp/NS_Ref -logging FINE


   This displays the usage:

     jaco javaclients.corba.ClientRaw -?


2. Example using a naming service to pass the server IOR.

   Another variant is to access xmlBlaster using a naming service.
   Please see our INSTALL file how to use the naming service.

   If you have the naming service running, and xmlBlaster has
   published itself to the naming service try:

     jaco javaclients.corba.ClientRaw


3. Example using the xmlBlaster builtin http server.

   This is only available with our CorbaConnection.java
   helper classes (see examples in demo/javaclients).
