These demo clients run with any protocol supported by xmlBlaster,
you can choose the protocol used with the -protocol
command line setting (see below).

Currently supported are 'IOR' for CORBA, 'RMI', 'XMLRPC' and 'SOCKET'.

The default protocol used by these clients is CORBA/IIOP.

The demos connect to xmlBlaster and do some subscribing and
publishing of messages.


   Start xmlBlaster server:

      java org.xmlBlaster.Main


   Start one of the clients, for example:

      java HelloWorld3


   To get some more logging infos try:

      java HelloWorld3 -trace true


   This displays the usage:

     java HelloWorld3 -?


   Query xmlBlaster:

      java javaclients.ClientQuery -queryXpath "/xmlBlaster/key"

      java javaclients.ClientQuery -queryXpath "//AGENT/DRIVER"


Running a client with CORBA protocol (default):

      jaco javaclients.ClientSub -dispatch/connection/protocol IOR

Running a client with RMI protocol:

      java javaclients.ClientSub -dispatch/connection/protocol RMI

Running a client with XMLRPC protocol:

      java javaclients.ClientSub -dispatch/connection/protocol XMLRPC

Running a client with SOCKET protocol:

      java javaclients.ClientSub -dispatch/connection/protocol SOCKET

Running a client which forces the GUI based authentication/authorization plugin:

      java javaclients.ClientSub -Security.Client.DefaultPlugin gui,1.0 \
                                 -Security.Client.Plugin[gui][1.0] \
                                  org.xmlBlaster.authentication.plugins.demo.ClientPlugin

NOTE: To run these other protocols, the xmlBlaster server must
      have switched on the supporting driver (see xmlBlaster.properties)
      They are switched on as default.
