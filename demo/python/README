We have three Python client variants available:

1. pyBlaster from Peter Arwanitis (spex66 @ gmx . net)
   This is a fairly complete python client to xmlBlaster
   using XmlRpc as access protocol.
   It is simple and brilliant.
   See: xmlBlaster/src/python/README

2. CORBA access with omniORBpy by Oleg Orlov (orlov@diasoft.ru)
   This is a smart example how to access xmlBlaster from Python
   with CORBA.
   It is a powerful example.
   See: xmlBlaster/demo/python/corba/README

3. A simple XmlRpc based access client from Marcel Ruff
   This is outdated and was a first step for access verification.
   See: xmlBlaster/demo/python/deprecated/README


TODO:
  We need to cleanup all above approaches and layer the protocol
  (like CORBA or XmlRpc) below some general python classes
  to simplify xmlBlaster access from Python
