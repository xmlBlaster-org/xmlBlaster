release info
------------

This is version 0.9.8 of xmlrpclib.py.

This version adds support for Secret Labs' fast sgmlop XML parser.
When using sgmlop, XMLRPC unmarshalling is up to 20 times faster
than earlier versions. Marshalling is also slightly faster than
before.

This version also makes it easier to plug in your own favourite XML
parser, and to use other network transports.  See the new Parser and
Transport classes for details.

This is beta software.  There are no known bugs.

The XMLRPC specification can be found at:
