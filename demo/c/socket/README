  C based SOCKET access to xmlBlaster, June 2003
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a C based SOCKET client to xmlBlaster.
It should compile on Linux, Windows (PocketPC, WinCE) and other UNIX OS.

Please read 

  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.c.socket.html

for more details.


Compile:
--------

  cd xmlBlaster
  build c    (Windows or UNIX)

This will first create a shared library (dll) in xmlBlaster/lib
and than compile the demo clients in this directory.
The executables are put to xmlBlaster/demo/c/socket/bin



Run:
----

  java org.xmlBlaster.Main

  bin/LogRedirect -logLevel TRACE


Compiling/Debugging with eclipse:
---------------------------------

We provide
   .cdtproject .project .cdtbuild
to compile with eclipse >= 3.2 and CDT >= 3.1.0

Add to your environment:

   export usr_lib_dir=/usr/lib
   export zlib_include_dir=/opt/zlib-bin/include
   export zlib_lib_dir=/opt/zlib-bin/lib

to find the third party libraries.

Add the Project over File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace
and add xmlBlaster/src/c++ for 'Select root directory'. (Tested with Linux)

   # Example C++ compilation with eclipse 3.2 and CDT 3.1.0 64 bit (all libs installed as RPM):
   export usr_lib_dir=/usr/lib64
   export zlib_include_dir=/usr/include
   export zlib_lib_dir=/usr/lib64
