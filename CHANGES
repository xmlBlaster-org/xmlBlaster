Changes for current svn
=======================

 o r17955 API behaviour change: unSubscribe does not throw exception for XPath without matches anymore

 o r17952 You can now send specific exceptions back in your security plugin Session#isAuthorized method via
             dataHolder.setExceptionToThrow(myXmlBlasterException);
	     return false;
	  instead of the default ErrorCode.USER_SECURITY_AUTHORIZATION_NOTAUTHORIZED

 o r17947 Fixed XPATH unSubscribe, the parent subInfo was not destroyed"

 o r17891 ConnectQosSaxFactory.java fixed to handle <address> subtags like <compress>

 o r17887 Creating small Java client jar xmlBlasterClient.jar
          'build -DJVM.source=1.6 -DJVM.target=1.6 dist-client-mini'
          Refactored to have smaller java client library with SOCKET support without concurrent.jar or joda-time.jar dependency

 o r17866 - r17877 Connection pings: Using now a ThreadPool to ping remote side
          Avoid delayed pings for others if one callback client is blocking  

 o r17860 StompDriver: Fixed leak, better logging

 o r17787 Stomp client integration see http://stomp.codehaus.org/ for easy integration of any clients
          like the iPhone.

 o r17776 htpasswd authorization: Supporting now topic names starting with specific token:
          WeatherProxy:yZxMiqIKTc:connect,disconnect,publish("startsWith:weather."),subscribe("startsWith:weather."),unSubscribe

 o r17773 Extended Security plugin interface to be able to intercept exceptions thrown back to clients
          Added new method I_Session#interceptExeptionByAuthorizer():
	  Incompatible API change in I_Session!
	  Add a dummy implementation and return null to have original behaviour (in case you have your own security plugin)

 o r17770 HtPasswd Authentication/Authorization: If a loginName matches exactly only this is evaluated
          before all other matching entries where used to find a valid password

 o r17768 Fixing gap that a quickly reconnecting client leads to missing toPolling() toAlive() firing cylce (race condition)
          Had impact for cluster setup with callback tunnel


Changes for 2.0.0 [2009-09-09] r17766 (JDK >= 1.5 only)
=======================================================

 o r17755 Incompatible java client API change: Added I_ConnectionStatusListener#toAliveSync
          which tells the listener as soon as all queued back client side messages are delivered to the server
          and further server calls are synchronous (the returned data is from the real server).
          The compiler will tell the places to add this method to your code.

 o r17749 Dropped Active X support via JDK bridge. Please use the new C backed C# code.

 o r17744 fixed XmlBuffer also for the QueryKeyData

 o r17739 NPE for set administrative command (CoreHandler.java)

 o r17737 XmlBlasterAccess.java changed behaviour:
          On toDead() the connect() method now throws a XmlBlasterException of type COMMUNICATION_NOCONNECTION_DEAD

 o r17730 added flag mail.messageIdFileName to allow to change the filename for the message id in the mail 
          protocol

 o r17724 fixed what did not have been completely fixed on r17703

 o r17722 keys in the callbackMap are not xml encoded. subscriptionIds coming from the server are encoded. 
          This way the entry was never found in the map and it resulted in invoking the connection general 
          listener instead. This has now been fixed.

 o r17720 MsgInfo: fixed errror which resulted in a forced default configuration if toLiteral was invoked 
          before having configured the associated parser" xmlBlaster/util/xbformat/MsgInfo.java

 o r17711 Added additional features to xmlrpc (xmlScript and inhibit CDATA in content)
 
 o r17703 Bugfix: now subscriptions done with a negative sessionId are throwing an exception and are not 
          queued on the client side when the server is not available, this fixes a bug which resulted in a 
          loop when the xmlBlaster was available again.

 o r17692 Bugfix: SAX parser character seems to sometimes be not resetted (after a exception) which can lead
          to undefined behaviour

 o r17685 Update to quartz scheduler v1.6.5

  o r17681 Added tunnelling of callbacks on the xmlrpc protocol. This allows to pass requests through a
          proxy, using https either all the way between client/server or to use an intermediate reverse
          proxy which converts the https protocol to http. Compression can also be used.

 o r17673 Added Security.DefaultPluginType=hwpasswd configuration possibility

 o r17671 CallbackAddress.java fixed envPrefix SOCKET->XMLRPC

 o r17655 ported xmlrpc protocol to version 3 (3.1.1) and added possibility to wrap contents in CDATA.

 o r17643 EventPlugin sending email always from separate timer thread

 o r17641 fixed subscriptionId which was wrong if XmlBuffer modified its content to make it xml compliant.
          Aware for XPATH subscribes which are escaped: If old client is updated to new client:
          Server side queued messages could be wrong dispatched in client code
          if subscribe with client side dispatcher is used

 o r17633 Removed org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64 dependency

 o r17630 Bugfix: fixed bug in email protocol when the requestId was not a long (was apparently introduced 2008-06-01)

 o r17619 Bugfix: 2008-12-10
          Bug introduced with r16911 ConnectQosData.java 2008-05-03 17:35:04
          Native clients (protocl=LOCAL) without callback server configured (xmlBlasterAccess.connect(qos, null))
          can't login to xmlBlaster anymore, this is for example the FilePollerPlugin

 o r17598 VERY IMPORTANT CHANGE with xmlBlaster persistence layer, PLEASE READ THIS!
          The default configuration now uses the new JdbcQueue database persistence layer with three tables 
	       'xbstore', 'xbref', 'xbmeat'.
          If you have data in the old schema 'xb_entries' they are NOT used.
          In case you need the old data please read
            http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.html

 o r17581 C-client library: 
          Introduced Timestamp.c for thread safe requestId counter
          CallbackServer responseListener handling is now mutex protected
          cb->removeResponseListener added as MsgRequestInfoP is on stack (still race condition is possible!!!)

 o r17576 Changed I_Queue interface to use List<I_Entry> instead of ArrayList

 o r17575 New persistency: All DB access is going now over XBDatabaseAccessorDelegate

 o r17564 Fixed ClassCastException in MsgQueuePublishEntry.getReceiver()

 o r17553 C++ client library: Bug fix for not calling postSend() in case of catch(...) and not handled by client code

 o r17532 C-client library: Fixed pthread_t initialization in Timeout.c (used by new HelloWorld4.c only)
          Fixed compiler warnings for intel icc


Changes for 1.6.4 [2008-11-18] r17524 'JDK14-GoodBye'
=====================================================

 o r17427 JDBC Database layer: Ported StorageId to new XBSTORE table, change for xb_entries (revert to r17426 on problems)

 o r17377 Sending cluster connection info with heartbeat XML mail
          <connection clusterId='avalon' id='heron'><session id='1'><state>POLLING</state><queue relating='connection' numOfEntries='24' maxNumOfEntries='10000000' numOfBytes='57600' maxNumOfBytes='2147483647'/>...

 o r17372 Cluster SSL callback tunnel: fixed client side connectionState transition
          Added EventPlugin support for cluster client connectionState:
	   "client/[subjectId]/session/[publicSessionId]/event/connectionState"

 o r17366 Added DDL for SQLServer 2005 and 2008 for new storage plugin 'JdbcStorage[MicrosoftSQLServer2005]=org.xmlBlaster.util.queue.jdbc.JdbcQueue,...'
          Does not support 2000, you would need to configure TEXT and IMAGE instead of VARCHAR(MAX) and VARBINARY(MAX)

 o r17358 Changed I_Map interface by adding a new method updateCounters

 o r17351 Changed ping to check database with new created connection, as Connection from pool could be stale
          e.g. com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: Connection reset by peer: socket write error

 o r17347 Deadlock fix in SessionInfo.java
          Removed synchronized to prevent dead lock, see discussion with Bal�zs P�ka 2008-10-28

 o r17340 C-client library: Supports now fail safe reconnect polling and client side ping

 o r17302 Administrative control to block client logins and reset the connection of a client (jconsole)
          See jconsole: subject: blockClientLogin, blockClientAndResetConnections
          See jconsole: blockClientSessionLogin, disconnectClientKeepSession

 o r17291 C# client: Fixed registerProgressListener, clean up directory structure, monodevelop added missing files

 o r17285 Checkpoint plugin: added client-cluster check point 'client.publish.enter'.
 
 o r17272 FileWatcherPlugin: can now be run standalone (for that getNativeConnectArgs() has been removed since 
          it is already invoked in GlobalInfo). 

 o r17261 C client library: Checking for null pointer in gethostbyname because of iPhone

 o r17231 C client library: Ported to iPhone 3G, on Mac OSX compile with 'build -Duse-gcc=true c'
          uses define __MacOSX__. In XCode please set -D__IPhoneOS__=1 compile define.

 o r17218 cluster setup: if circular loop (slave -> master -> same slave) an exception is thrown by master already
          Switch back to old behaviour with cluster/allowDirectLoopback=true
	  For publishes in Pub/Sub and PtP mode.

 o r17215 First beta of Micheles new JDBC storage layer for xmlBlaster, uses three tables XBSTORE, XBREF, XBMEAT
          Activate in xmlBlaster.properties with
	    JdbcStorage[Oracle]=org.xmlBlaster.util.queue.jdbc.JdbcQueue,\
	    ...

 o r17176 socket driver: Fix to not ignore <attribute name='updateResponseTimeout' type='long'>7200000</attribute>
          configurations from clients in ConnectQos <callback> section

 o r17173 Handle unparsable MsgUnit, e.g. for invalid Qos xml markup in case of !ConnectQos.allowExceptionsThrownToClient()

 o r17157 GlobalInfo: the parameter replacement is now done before AND after calling doInit (the extention's init method)

 o r17149 Passing through type/version from xmlBlaster.properties to htpasswd.SecurityQos,
          like this we are able to reuse htpasswd.SecurityQos.java for other security plugins
	  which have a loginName/password approach (client side)

 o r17145 GlobalInfo: the clash jdbc.drivers and JdbcDriver.drivers has now been fixed: you can set either the one or the other.

 o r17141 Replication: fixed handling of simultaneous operations. Note that also new statements shall be used as defined in the
          replication demo (demo/javaclients/contrib/replication).

 o r17138 Replication and DbWatcher: when sending multiple transactions in one message the 'maxMessageSize' limits the maximum size
          (does not break within the same transaction). Also the 'alreadyProcessedFlag' is not sent nor evaluated anymore.

 o r17118 Java client library: Synchronous request()
          Added possibility to specify topicId for request/reply with __responseTopicId or __responseTopicIdPrefix client property

 o r17102 Java client library: Fixed too frequently client reconnect polling if server is in RL4

 o 171001 Fixed potential race condition where SOCKET HandleClient was not removed from SocketDriver Set

 o r17097 Added "__UTC", the current timestamp of the client environment in ISO 8601 notation,
          to be send by clients on connect with ConnectQos clientProperty
          This allows to guess the server the offset for clients having misconfigured time
	  Is currently written as remoteProperty to the clients session for human usage (e.g. to compare log file entries)
	  Added joda-time-1.5.2 Apache License http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/

 o r17093 C++ client library: Implemented request/reply pattern, see xmlBlaster/testsuite/src/c++/TestRequestResponse.cpp
          Added administrative flag to PublishQos

 o r17082 CheckPoint new logging point "publish.enter"

 o r17073 CheckPoint now uses apache-log4j-1.2.15 http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2
	  via commons-logging 1.1.1 http://commons.apache.org/logging

 o r17054 MsgErrorHandler: Handles now incoming publish requests as well
          if configured by ConnectQosServer.allowExcpetionsThrownToClient=false by security plugin
	  Useful for dumb clients which can't handle exceptions (like mobile phones)
	  API for I_MsgErrorHandler#handleErrorSync changed to return string
	  DeadMessageDumper receiverSubdir=true: Creates now subdirectory with receiver name

 o r17049 C client library: Bugfix in strcatAlloc() which used wrong SIZE for strncat0()

 o r17036 PHP Client xmlBlaster/demo/php/xmlrpc/README
          Ported to PHP 5 and phpxmlrpc 2.2.1 http://phpxmlrpc.sourceforge.net/  

 o r17028 Cluster node client:
          If cluster client sending of publish fails it is dumped and removed from connection queue

 o r17025 ClientErrorHandler: Changed default behaviour to only shutdown on internal problems
          for async message sending failures (before for all none communication errors)

 o r17010 Sessions from persistence on xmlBlaster startup go to POLLING directly
          Cluster back tunnel now finds XmlBlasterAccess again after gateway restart

 o r17004 Fixed SOCKET driver to work on AddressServer clone instead of on the
          SocketDriver#addressServer singleton instance

 o r17002 AjaxServlet: Limit with MaxUserSessions (configurable via JMX)
          Added internationalization of exceptions
          e.g. put ajaxServlet_de.properties into the classpath of war
          Fixed session cleanup for error cases

 o r16985 AjaxServlet: Banned browser IP adresses with jconsole
          Added exception return to browser

 o r16955 SOCKET cluster: Protecting against multiple thread creation
          Notify acceptRemoteLoginAsTunnel shutdown (to avoid pinging)
          Invariant JMX cluster node name

 o r16941 SOCKET Java client library:
          Immediate notify socket EOF to Java client library,
          now pingInterval=0 works as well (for none blocking cases)

 o r16934 Bugfix: Closing socket on server side delayed to allow exception to reach the client
          Bugfix: On Java client side avoid calling ClientErrorHandler when the thread is sync from client code
          Throwing now COMMUNICATION_NOCONNECTION_DEAD instead of USER ErrorCode when no server and no fail save

 o r16925 Bugfix: On reconnect update persistent session store with new ConnectQos
          API change: Addd I_ClientListener#sessionUpdated(ClientEvent e) event to achieve this
          Bugfix: I_Map#change() fixed to do the change in MapPlugin and PersistentPlugin
          I_Map#change() supports now entries with different sizes

 o r16909 Java client library: Reject publish() etc. calls when state is DEAD

 o r16905 EmailDriver removed duplicate getAddressServer()

 o r16900 Updated to hsqldb_1_8_0_9

 o r16897 First hack to tunnel callback of cluster master by re-using the slaves connection

 o r16888 Java: Fixed hsqldb shutdown in JdbcConnectionPool.java to release .lck file
          if (this.managerCount < 1) shutdown() to be discussed

 o r16885 Cluster code refactored
 
 o r16870 Cluster: Fixed parsing connect qos in cluster environment (supports now attributes)
          Renamed NodeInfo to NodeConnectQos

 o r16870 Java: Refactored protocol API connect(): removed explicit AddressServer argument (was redundant)
          Fixed SessionInfo.updateConnectQos() so the new connectQos is available during processing
	  Passing now isAsync mode flag to avoid looping connection if connectQos is from client queue

 o r16838 Java: Fixed xmlBlasterAccess.leaveServer() client side memory leak

 o r16830 Clustering: Extended RoundRobin to properly handle domain routing with empty domain
          (support for acceptDefault and acceptOtherDefault)

 o r16804 Singleton approach to avoid race condition which could create two SessionInfo instances
          Avoid max number of sessions check when session is loaded from persistency during startup

 o r16817 Checkpoint plugin: Added client side Checkpoint client.publish.ack (used for cluster tracing)

 o r16809 Added extended JMX access to cluster configuration without shutdown (transient changes only)
          Changed to thread safe re-configuration during operation

 o r16803 Bugfix: Qos XML creation escaping properly illegal XML characters
          StatusQosSaxFactory/DisconnectQosSaxFactory/QueuePropertyBase/QueryQosSaxFactory/MsgKeySaxFactory

 o r16783 Bugfix: SOCKET with XmlScript markup (instead of XBF) configures now correctly
          from xmlBlaster.properties for callbacks and responses

 o r16780 Bugfix: Topic life cycle
          Changed topic creation state change to go directly to ALIVE on publish
	  and not go over UNREFERENCED as this could trigger a DEAD inbetween
	  if destroy delay is configured to 0 (or a small value)

 o r16779 Bugfix: DropIfNotDeliverable mime plugin: Fixed possible dead lock situation

 o r16766 Bugfix: A SaxParseException of a message QoS left the MsgQosSaxFactory in inconstent state
          and operation of xmlBlaster is broken as follow up parses can swallow QoS tags like <destination>

 o r16763 Force AjaxServlet to UTF-8 processing to support e.g. Umlauts

 o r16762 Servlet 2.4 API copied from apache-tomcat-5.5.23/common/lib" servlet.jar

 o r16757 The EventPlugin now sends emails asynchronously from a separate thread decoupled
          over a RAM based producer/consumer queue.
	  This is to protect the xmlBlaster core against blocking or slow SMTP agents.
	  See http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/admin.events.html (mail.sendAsync)
	  See http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/protocol.email.html (asyncSendQueueSizeMax)

 o r16744 Incompatible change of security plugin I_Session:
          1) Added method 'public ConnectQosServer init(ConnectQosServer connectQos, Map map)'
	  You need to add a dummy implementation if you use an own security plugin:
            public ConnectQosServer init(ConnectQosServer connectQos, Map map) throws XmlBlasterException {
              return connectQos;
            }
          2) Removed unused method public String init(String securityQos_literal)
	  3) The method public boolean verify(I_SecurityQos securityQos) can now throw an XmlBlasterException

          Session configuration in ConnectQos: maxSessions and clearSessions can now be
	  controlled in a security plugin to behave for pubSessionId<0 and pubSessionId>0 differently.
	  Remote configuration with ConnectQos is not yet implemented.
	  See ConnectQosServer#setSessionLimitsPubSessionIdSpecific(boolean)

 o r16738 Extended remoteProperty handling from clients (similar to existing jconsole functionality)
          Create a remote property:
            java javaclients.HelloWorldPublish -oid __sys__remoteProperties -connect/qos/clientProperty[__remoteProperties] true -connect/qos/clientProperty[myProperty] AAAAAA -session.name OTHER/1
          Access it:
            java javaclients.HelloWorldGet -clientProperty[__sessionName] OTHER/1 -oid __sys__remoteProperties
          Destroy it:
            java javaclients.HelloWorldPublish -oid __sys__remoteProperties -clientProperty[__sessionName] OTHER/1 -content clear

 o r16729 Added database dead lock recovery, on deadlock retry once.
          Added delegate for DB access to retry on dead lock situation (seldom case with SQLServer)
          Globales Setting (xmlBlaster.properties) to have old behaviour:
            xmlBlaster/useJdbcManagerDelegate=false
          Jdbc specific setting (only if above is true, else ignored) in JdbcStorage[MicrosoftSQLServer]:
            maxExceptionRetries=2
            retrySleepMillis=0
	  Performance tuning hint:
            [ create index IX_DATAID ON XB_ENTRIES (XB_dataId) - improvment not tested] (The primary key must remain a compound key of xb_dataId and queueName)
            create index IX_QUEUENAME ON XB_ENTRIES (queueName)
            create index IX_CB_QUEUE ON XB_ENTRIES (prio DESC, dataId ASC)      (Oracle, PostgreSQL)
            create index IX_CB_QUEUE ON XB_ENTRIES (prio DESC, XB_dataId ASC)   (SQLServer)
            create index IX_DURABLE ON XB_ENTRIES (durable)
  
 o r16722 Persistence queue/msgstore performance tuning
	  Reduced query interaction to 1/3 on startup
	   Cleanup for transient entries in one select on startup
	   Reload of cached numOfEntries, numOfPersistenEntries and numOfBytes and numOfPersistentBytes is now done with one select

 o r16720 EventPlugin: Added $_{loginName} and $_{pubSessionId} support

 o r16718 Replication: Strings containing control chars (ASCII < 13) are now base64 encoded

 o r16712 EventPlugin: Sending now ConnectQos-remoteProperty for callbackState events

 o r16710 EventPlugin: Sending now ConnectQos-remoteProperty preparsed in Login/Logout event clientProperty

 o r16708 EventPlugin: Added recursion detection for subscribe/unSubscribe events
          Added clientProperty '_url' for XPath use case

 o r16706 EventPlugin: Added client properties to event from SubscribeQos and UnSubscribeQos

 o r16702 Fixed MsgUnit - Qos XML markup: escape not allowed chars

 o r16693 Fixed XPath query multi threading bug, reported by John Horner 2008-01-12

 o r16689 Added recursive flag to filewatcher (to scan directories recursively).

 o r16676 C++ client library: Added ~ConnectQosData() because of crash on MacOSX

 o r16674 When an exception occurs in the update method it was converted to a COMMUNICATION
          and the original information was lost: now it is passed as embedded.

 o r16660 Catching client side exceptions of type other than user.* and communication.*
          and converting them to "user.update.internalError"

 o r16657 Fix to not shutdown xmlBlaster for severe client side exceptions during callback
          Problem could not occure for Java or C++ clients

 o r16654 Dead message generation: Now detecting 'isErrorHandled' specific for each
          queue instance (and not only for each MsgUnit).

 o r16652 C++ Implemented same I_PostSendEvent error handling as in Java


Changes for 1.6.2 [2007-12-03] r16646 'Openroads'
=================================================

 o r16639 Implemented I_PostSendListener for java clients and server
          to get notification on *asynchronous* send messages from queue:
	  1. postSend() delivers the ReturnQos
	  2. sendingFailed() delivers the Exception
	  Fixed java client: Now toDead() is called for all erroCodes despite communication
	  The previous code called toDead() only for user exceptions.

 o r16630 C++ client now compiles with xerces 2.8 (64bit or 32bit)

 o r16621 The FileWatcher and FileWriter can be managed by the HTML based replication monitor
          (similar to the database replication)

 o r16621 FileWatcher plugin for Java (supporting streaming mode for huge files)

          See http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/admin.checkpoint.html
	  for usage details (and xmlBlasterPlugins.xml to activate it and logging.properties to configure amount of details logged).
          See javadoc of xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/util/checkpoint/Checkpoint.java

 o r16528 Adjustable SmtpClient mail timeout (see xmlBlasterPlugins.xml example)

          trigger on the master side of a replication

 o r16469 removed double spanning of poll timer when going from ALIVE to POLLING
 
 o r16467 Replication: fixed in trigger timestamp is always using '.': was using locale punctuator
          resulting in an exception on the writing side. Also made writer more tollerant (would 
          handle a comma now)

 o r16457 Continue loading sessions from persistence even if one fails (e.g. because of changed authentication)
          TODO: Implement generic approach to handle such sessions (security plugin should grant access if coming
          from persistent store).

 o r16449 JMX control
          - Added SessionInfo getCbQueueBytes() and getCbQueueBytesCache()
            These are the bytes of the refence objects only (not containing the message itself)
          - Fixed allowedToReconfigureTopicAndFixWrongLimits() typo at: if (currentMaxEntries > historyProps.getMaxEntries())
          - Added reportMemoryOverview() and reportMemoryOverviewToFile(String file) on node level
          - Added I_Map: getNumOfCachedEntries and getNumOfCachedBytes
          Configuration of 
             persistence/msgUnitStore/maxEntriesCache
             persistence/msgUnitStore/maxEntries
             persistence/msgUnitStore/maxBytesCache
             persistence/msgUnitStore/maxBytes
            and the history queue equivalents
            is now enforced on restart of xmlBlaster during persistent topic recovery
          Bugfix of checkConsistency(I_Map, fixIt, reportFileName) which reported
          leaks which probably weren't.


 o r16444 removed synchronized in CacheQueueInterceptorPlugin.clear since it caused a deadlock
          when clearing a callback queue and publishing messages at the same time

 o r16442 Fixed to avoid remote DNS hostname lookup if hostname given is raw IP
          Added to avoid DNS localHostname lookup if localHostname given is raw IP

 o r16430 EventPlugin: Added missing support for wildcards in event type callbackState
          client/*/session/*/event/callbackState

 o r16416 Bugfix XmlScript over SOCKET: Fixed to use configured parser on callback ping

 o r16264 SocketUrl: changed the Exception to be a communication for cases where the host is temporarly 
          unavailable. If you have a positive SessionId it will go in polling (as opposed to before where 
          it went to dead)

 o r16283 Replication:
          Added property 'dbWriter.quoteColumnNames=false', set to true for DB2 host sinks (e.g. "COMMENT")

 o r16187 Fixed cluster client queue to have unique storageId
          Use -xmlBlaster/cluster/useLegacyClientQueueName true forces old behavior

 o r16185 Fixed using ServerScope in ConnectQos which used wrong ServerEntryFactor on client side

 o r16182 QueryQosData.java: Escape subscriptionId if it contains apos to avoid invalid XML

 o r16181 ServerEntryFactory.java: Changed to ignore case of type during persistence recovery

 o r16178 fix: failsave + authentication errors now kill the connection 
          (they went in polling before)

 o r16170 EmbeddedXmlBlaster: changed the way the global is created since the
          embedded would otherwise use the default xmlBlaster.properties

 o r16168 Updated to ant-contrib/cpptasks from svn 2007-05-20
          To try to resolve C/C++ compilation/runtime problems with Windows crazy manifest approach

 o r16164 C++ client library: Fixed generatedSubscriptionId to escape ' quote to prevent malformed QoS XML

 o r16145 added to get missing code to retrieve also props with no prefix (for example java.version) to Global

          an initial class instance directly after Main(String[])

 o r16130 Extended SOCKET protocol plugin to immediately forward the EOF on client disconnect
          to support callback configurations with switched off pinging  (e.g. mobile phones with high cost GPRS/UMTS).

 o r16109 Added switch 
            -xmlBlaster/jmx/support false
          or
            -xmlBlaster/jmx/createSecurityManager false
	  to support embedded EJB3 jboss plugin without loosing JMX jconsole support

 o r16078 Update to HSQLDB 1.8.0.7 from September 2006

 o r16075 The SOCKET connection transports the client side IP address to the security plugins
          Extension by Xavier Roques

 o r16051/r16053 Bugfix: Support for r15953 subscriptionId in cluster environment

 o r16050 Prevent clients from using same login name as server cluster.node.id

 o r16045 C client library fix for Win32 and WinCE
          You can now pass raw IP address without DNS lookup

 o r16022 Bugfix C client library
          The disconnect is not oneway (see protocol.socket specification),
	  this bug was introduced in r15972 2007-02-07.
	  Fixed memory leak for unexpected reveived messages (does not happen in normal operation).
	  Increased max. waiting on pending update threads to 10 sec (during shutdown).

 o r16022 Bugfix The new SessionName '/session/' tag introduced a subtle bug which could lead
          to failed reconnect on same session.
	  This bug was introduced with revision r15523

 o r16021 Bugfix & extension for administrative 'event/callbackState'
          It now fires on the initial login a "ALIVE" or "POLLING" event
	  The subjectId and/or the publicSessionId can now be a wildcard "*".
	  The connect and disconnect event now support wildcarded subjectId.
          See: http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/admin.events.html

 o r15994 Added C and C++ project files for eclipse and VC++2005
          See xmlBlaster/src/c/README and xmlBlaster/src/c++/README
          See xmlBlaster/demo/socket/README and xmlBlaster/demo/c++/README

 o r15980 C++ client library: Partially added support for WINCE
          Porting to MSXML and fixing errno.h in omnithread is missing

 o r15967-r15972 Mac OSX c client library compilation patch

Changes for 1.5 [2007-01-28] r15961
===================================

 o r15953 C++ and Java client library now create client side subscriptionId if
          pubSessionId>0 and multiSubscribe=false (fail safe operation).
          Like this we avoid returning a temporary subscriptionId if a subscribe is queued
          on client side (during POLLING).

 o r15949 made volatile all variables which are used in a double checked locking idiom (should be 
          safe in new MEM Model as JDK 1.5) 

 o r15934 Fixed java client library for changing client side IP address
          Reconnect is now supported.
          Security fix which allowed hijacking the callback address

 o r15930 Dead letter is now not containing <oid>...</oid> anymore
          Is send already QoS

 o r15906 Switched off dynamically loadable plugins as a default setting.
          See http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.runlevel.howto.html#dynamic
 
 o r15866 added the possibility to disable going to polling if a response timeout comes from a ping:
          use dispatch/callback/stallOnPingTimeout=true or/and dispatch/connection/stallOnPingTimeout=true.
          This property is passed in the AddressBase

 o r15851 C# client: Csharp support extended
          o Supporting C and C++ clients as unmanaged code on Windows CE and normal Windows
          o Supporting C# as managed code on Windows CE and normal Windows and Mono/Linux
          See http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.c.windowsCE.html
	  See http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.csharp.html

 o r15794 C++ client: Changed PublishReturnQos and SubscribeReturnQos in case of client side queueing
          to be identical to java client behaviour:
	  state id="OK"        (previously it was "QUEUED")
	  state info="QUEUED   (previously it was "")
	  See http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/interface.subscribe.html#return

 o r15750 C client: Full Windows CE port (including pthreads 2.7.0 and zlib 1.2.3)
          See http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.c.windowsCE.html

 o r15742 C client: First runnable Windows CE port (without pthreads)
          Added: -DWINCE compiler define
          Open: Is there any getenv() for Windows CE?, how to handle errno.h?
          Changed: -DDLL_BUILD to -D_WINDLL
          __FreeBSD__ code in helper.c is probably broken (needs testing)

 o r15735 dispatch statistics are cleaned up on the client side on reconnect also, this fixes a failing reconnect in case
          the update had activities, the connection ping detected a stale connection and the update ping did not return.

 o r15733 Fixed introduced error when removing entries from queues where the
          metadata returned 0 for maxNumSequences.

 o r15727 C client: Finished port to VC8 with support for VC7 and VC6.

 o r15713 Cb ignores ping failure in case an update is blocking (no activity). On the client side
          however an exception is thrown to allow a reconnect

 o r15697 C++ client: Added client side queue accessor to xmlBlasterAccess->getQueue()

 o r15684 Fixed I_Queue.clear() of cache queue implementation
          It only removed the entries in the cache but now
          it correctly removes the swapped out persistent messages as well
          TODO: Add a testcase

 o r15682 Added java.sql.Connection delegate DebugConnection.java
          for advanced failure detection (contains assert code only)

 o r15644 Fixed htpasswd plugin for '*:<passwd>' entries.
          This feature got lost during adding of authorization code (see r15446).
          Is now assured by testcase
 
 o r15643 Added experimental maxFetchSize to limit queries.
          Default to unlimited as before, example:
          QueuePlugin[CACHE][1.0]=org.xmlBlaster.util.queue.cache.CacheQueueInterceptorPlugin,
                persistentQueue=JDBC,transientQueue=RAM,maxFetchSize=100

 o r15629 Added I_StreamingCallback which can be passed to an XmlBlasterAccess.connect. You can 
          thereby read messages in streaming mode. A client side update queue having the same
          cfg as the client queue can be optionally used.
 
Changes for 1.4 [2006-10-22] r15612
===================================

 o r15591 FilePoller: Fixed file.delete() with a hack, it failed sometimes on Windows platforms

 o r15587 SQL92Filter plugin has as default now switched caching of prepared query off
          See http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/mime.plugin.access.sql92.html

 o r15582 Updated cup parser from 'CUP v0.10k Parser' to 'CUP v0.11a beta 20060608 Parser'

 o r15571 Changed I_SecurityQos interface to have exchangable SecurityQos for ldap,htpasswd,simple
          This allows changing the server side security plugin (from for example htpasswd to ldap)
          even if the client is not touched.

 o r15563 Bugfix: Thread/memory leak on clients with failed authentication
          and not closing the socket

 o r15562 Bugfix: NPE during callback of oneway messages

 o r15557 Added switch -xmlBlaster/useSessionMarker (defaults to false)
          To switch between old "client/joe/1" notation and new "client/joe/session/1" notation
	  Default is again false to be backward compatible with older clients,
	  should be changed to true on release 2.0

 o r15556 Fixed C++ client to handle 'joe/2' or 'joe/session/2' or 'client/joe/session/2' syntax

 o r15549 Fixed the possible NPE in SocketConnection in case a client wants to use it directly. It can now read the cfg out of
          the Global properties too, thanks to Oliver Fels. 
 
 o r15541 Fixed plugin load/unload/reload lifecycle, fixed plugin JMX re-registration

 o r15534 Added support for dynamically loaded plugins, the jar file is send in the message content
          See http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.runlevel.howto.html#dynamic

 o r15525 added cleanup of reads in dispatch statistics when an exception occurs when writing to the socket (normally by pings).
          Without it clients would not reconnect if the exception occured when receiving messages.

 o r15524 Using now default XML parser of the virtual machine (usually no configuration
          is needed in xmlBlaster.properties anymore)

 o r15523 Changed default syntax from 'client/joe/1' to 'client/joe/session/1
          Passing old notation is still supported

 o r15522 Added default XML parser / XSL settings for IBM JDK 1.4 and IBM JDK 1.5

 o r15513 You can now send messages containing one plugin as in
          xmlBlasterPlugins.xml and this is dynamically added without
          xmlBlaster restart. Further configuration can be done over jconsole.
          Sending a jar file with plugin specific code is not yet implemented.
          Example:
            java javaclients.HelloWorldPublish -oid __sys__RunlevelManager -contentFile plugin.xml

 o r15511 Added support for runlevel plugin activation/deactivation from JMX / jconsole
 
 o r15506 Fixed C client library cast for Solaris


Changes for 1.3 [2006-09-10] r15505
===================================

 o r15488 Fixed QueueQueryPlugin / receive() to support multiple blocking clients on same queue instance

 o r15485 added to MINSTR token for currentTime to the DbWatcher TimestampDetector

 o r15465 receive() leaking threads fixed:
          The I_Queue implementations now fire changed() in shutdown as well
          allowing the blocking queue query threads to return.
          Before the receive() threads were leaked if the queue disappeared
          as a notify was never triggered

 o r15459 Bugfix receive(): Could deadlock because of synchronize declaration in CoreHandler

 o r15446 htpassed plugin: Extended to support authorization on 'xpath:' and 'domain:' specific access

 o r15438 SOCKET protocol: Calling xmlBlaster core is now in a dispatched thread to support concurrent ping()
          and other method invocations. Fixes for example long lasting subscribes and blocking gets.

 o r15419 added dispatch statistic to client dispatcher and added bypass of ping in case there is a writing- or
          reading activity on that dispatcher. This fixes ping failures due to ongoing write/read operations

 o r15413 XmlRpc callback: Fixed to throw COMMUNICATION exceptions on ping or updateOneway failures
          and for update() exceptions thrown on server side

 o r15412 Prevent NPE if topicProperty is null

 o r15397 -Fixed dump to file (added out.close())
          -Nicer, human readable dump conforming to XmlScript markup
	  -Added reference counting check, see I_AdminMap.checkConsistency() and I_AdminNode.checkConsistency()
	  -Fixed to activate destroyTimeout setting when administrative or coming from persistence on startup
	  -Fixed eliminating topicHandler duplicates in persistent store during startup
	  -Changed persistent messages to be transient for session callback queues with negative session ID
	   as those wouldn't be found deterministic after restart

 o r15390 ConnectionPool now throws away Connection in case of an exception in the jdbc queue

 o r15381 C# client library: Added Csharp wrapper around xmlBlaster client C library (xmlBlaster/src/csharp/NativeC.cs)
          See http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.csharp.html

 o r15357 I_Entry.removed is now invoked outside synchronize in queues to avoid deadlock

 o r15348 Increased information density of server side logging (similar to good old org.jutils times)

 o r153xx I_Queue implementation: the toDestroyed() callback is now outside any synchronized

 o r15337 Property.java: when retrieving someCtx* only someCtx's childs where returned, now the exact match is returned too.

 o r15334 changed the threading pool of dispatcher since it was only using minimumPoolSize 

 o r15326 Fixed spam prevention if client logs in after a PtP arrived in its callback queue (with forceQueueing=true)

 o r15323 Changed server side behavior on COMMUNICATION exceptions thrown actively from client side
          Accept now client side COMMUNICATION exception
	  This should only be thrown by the client side low level protocol library on demand (e.g. on socket shutdownCbServer())

 o r15313 htpasswd plugin extension: Added primitive authorization support based on method name and topic oid
          See: http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/security.htpasswd.html#authorization
	  Changed to allow empty passwords (like "joe::") which grants access for joe

 o r15308 C client library: Removed pthread dependency when compiling single thread version with -DXB_NO_PTHREADS

 o r15294 Fix for XMLRPC protocol layer to transform all weired, client thrown exceptions into a "user.update.internalError"
          instead of a "internal.unkown"

 o r15293 Fix for SOCKET protocol layer to transform all weired, client thrown exceptions into a "user.update.internalError"
          instead of a "internal.unkown". (Is correctly done by IOR protocol)

 o r15280, r15288-r15290 Bugfix in xmlBlaster server-core (TopicHandler)
          Major redesign to handle race conditions:
          All access to a TopicHandler instance is no single threaded and done over TopicAccessor
          All access over reference counting / weak references is done as 'dirty read'
          Fixed double TopicHandler unregister on erase(false)

 o r15261 JMX invocations: Fixed invocation with none-String arguments, see

   Start xmlBlaster and try in your browser:
     http://YOUR-IP:3412/status.html
   See
     http://www.xmlblaster.org/screenshot.html#native
   - Added LogNotifierDeviceFactory
   - Added file loader from CLASSPATH, global.getFromClasspath()
   - Added more administrative access methods

 o r13539 Added native plugin which delivers a simple HTML page
   with the xmlBlaster status.
   The delivered page is configurable to show any administrative command.

 o r13525-13528 Added native http based xmlBlaster monitoring plugin
   (generic HTML design is still under construction)

 o r13524 adjusted Xerces-C++ build settings
   Sax2Parser.h und Sax2Parser.cpp: fixed includes
   Use 
     xerces.include.dir
     xerces.lib.dir
   in build.properties to set the location of the
   Xerces-C++ Library to be used for the C++ Part.
   XMLCPP_HOME and XMLCPP_VER is not supported anymore.
   
 o r13513 C++ client library
   Added convenience method XmlBlasterAccess.setCallbackDispatcherActive(bool)

 o r13505 Changed C++ ConnectQos to be reference counted
   Added convenience method XmlBlasterAccess.sendAdministrativeCommand()

 o r13502 Bugfix C++ integration of C client library
   Return value of bool update(...) changed to XMLBLASTER_C_bool
   On Windows C++ bool is a 'char' and the C bool is a 'int'
   This mismatch left 3 bytes on the EAX register undefined and lead to wrong bool settings
   when passing a bool from C++ to C.

 o r13491,r13492 JMX Added jmxremote.jar to compile on JDK < 1.5

 o Added administrative access methods, for example
   "numPublish", "numSubscribe" etc.
   Renamed "numUpdates" to "numUpdate"

 o r13477-r13482 Added JMX functionality
   for session, topic and queue handling

 o r13470,r13474 Extended query string syntax
   The constructors of
      GetKey(String,String)
      EraseKey(String,String)
      SubscribeKey(String,String)
      UnSubscribeKey(String,String)
   accept now the query string in URL syntax,
   for example a topic oid like "Hello" or "oid:Hello"
   or a query like "xpath://key", "domain:CLUSTER"
   Topic oid is now checked to not contain apostrophe ' or "

 o r13463 Bugfix user.security.authentication.accessdenied
   - Collecting new ConnectReturnQos after reconnect
   - Setting new instanceId on multiple connect() calls

 o r13462 Bugfix user.security.authentication.accessdenied
   Java client library now does another connect() if
   accessdenied is thrown from server.
   This can happen when a client session is destroyed in the
   server as an administrative task or by other means.
   Note: If the client is not fail safe configured and his callback address
   is buggy, the server always destroys the session and the client
   always reconnects which could lead to a loop.

 o r13461 Dispatcher change (java)
   Moved all protocol driver shutdown calls outside
   of synchronization blocks to avoid deadlocks
   if shutdown blocks and client wants to reconnect.

 o r13460 SOCKET protocol driver change (java)
   Moved all native socket close() calls outside
   of synchronization blocks.
   Like this a blocking system call won't deadlock
   the clients reconnect attempts.
   Changed to pass thru communication exceptions.

 o r13459 Bugfix SOCKET protocol driver
   Catching now throwable to always ensure the release of invocation locks
   Otherwise a blocked thread could result

 o r13459 Bugfix SOCKET protocol fail safe reconnect: SO_LINGER changed from one minute to 0
   The java socket.close() could block in the kernel
   when the ethernet cable was plugged out.
   SO_LINGER>0: Try to send any unsent data on close(socket)
                The UNIX kernel waits very long and ignores the given time
   SO_LINGER=0: Discard remaining data on close() <-- Choose this to avoid blocking socket close() calls
   Default:     The kernel tries to send queued data even after close()

 o r13458 Bugfix SOCKET protocol fail safe reconnect
   plugin/socket/responseTimeout callback exceptions are handled now as
   communication exception and trigger polling for client instead of
   creating dead messages.

 o r13449 C++ client library
   - Cleanup of true/false string handling
   - Extended ConnectQos to handle "refreshSession", "reconnected" and "instanceId"
   - Bugfix Base64 clientProperty handling in ConnectQos SAX parsing
   - WARNING:
     The AddressBase class is now reference counted, you may not create
     any Address instance on the stack, always use 'new Address(...)' or 'new CbAddress(...)'.
     Please access methods with '->' instead of '.'.
   - Threads: omni_mutex locks now support recursive entry, the same thread may enter recursively
     This extends POSIX 1.c: There the results of recursively locking the mutex is undefined
     and usually blocks.
   - Changed fail safe reconnect to make an initial try directly after detection
   - Added getInstanceId() to Global
   - XmlBlasterAccess.cpp
     Bugfix for multiple connect() calls.
     Changed invocationMutex to allow recursive calls,
     set xmlBlaster/invocationMutex/recursive=false for old behavior.
   - Cleanup of bool converter methods and "true"/"false" usage
     "1", "true" and "TRUE" are evaluated to true.
   - Changed Timeout::addOrRefreshTimeoutListener() to ignore key<=0 (and r13465)
   - Bugfix for method Timeout::refreshTimeoutListener()

 o r13428-13432 ConnectReturnQos
   Added instanceId which is unique when restarting the server

 o r13427 Bugfix for reconnect (java client library)
   Fixes for IOR and XMLRPC the reconnect behaviour
   if client session was killed by administrative task

 o r13409 Extended JMX support
   Added 'build -DADD_JMXTOOLS=true ... dist' configuration
   to add jmxtools.jar to distribution (needed for HTMLAdaptor)

 o r13402 Extended JMX support
   - Observe/change Logging

 o r13397 Added port for persistency in Firebird database
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.firebird.html
   Donated by Chris Lau ckl_88@yahoo.ca under LGPL

     e.g. operation killClient() instead of getKillClient()
   - Changed getKillClient() to operation killClient()
   - Changed getKillSession() to operation killSession()
   - Added TopicHandler MBean control
   - Added TopicHandler eraseTopic and accessors administrative commands

============================================================
 
 o r13335 C and C++ client library
   Port to Microsoft VC++ 8 Express 2005 beta2

 o r13338 Java SOCKET protocol (server side):
   Changed to avoid DNS host name lookup on connect which could lead
   to blocking for a missing DNS server (reverse lookup) until timeout occurred.

 o r13335 C++ client library
   Removed needless comma after namespace declaration to compile with g++ 4.0

 o r13330 C++ client library
   Forced to not put SubscribeQos into client side persistent queue (SQLite)
   even whith persisten=true, as we have not yet coded the retrieval (RAM based queueing only)

 o r13327 added pure regex to filepoller plugin.

 o r13323 Bugfix C++ client library
   Fixed reconnect when server was away and C++ ping hasn't yet detected it

 o r13322 finalized dispatcherActive property (r13300)
   Now it works on reconnect as well

 o r13319 Changed SOCKET timeout behaviour (Java/C/C++ clients)
   Changed to throw COMMUNICATION_TIMEOUT instead of RESOURCE_EXHAUST
   when the method call with SOCKET blocks after the specified timeout.
   Like that the not delivered message is queued by default,
   before the exeception was thrown back to the client code.

 o r13316 Bugfix FilePoller
   Fixed session timeout after one day
   Fixed deadlock on xmlBlaster shutdown if FilePoller had problems

 o r13310 Bugfix cluster
   ClusterNode.getConnectionState() did not reliable tell the truth
   Thanks to Michael Lum

   Added client side persistence code for subscribe() (deserialize is not finished)
   Added client side queueing for subscribe(), currently RAM based only
   Moved priority handling to QosData.cpp

 o r13300 Added dispatcherActive property to ConnectQos to support
   inhibiting callbacks on login, see
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/interface.connect.html#dispatcherActive
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/interface.connect.html#dispatcherActiveExample

 o r13299 C++ client library
   Fixed to send command line callback address property settings with ConnectQos

 o r13295 Added new server methods for administrative access:
    getServerTimestampMillis(): Access current server time in milli seconds
    getServerTimestamp(): Access current server time, e.g. "2005-03-21 11:18:12.622"

 o r13280 Removed outdated SOAP protocol plugins

Changes for 1.0.2 [2005-02-24] r13271 "Xmas release patch 2"
============================================================

 o r13266 Bugfix for QosData.clone() which didn't deep clone the client property map
   This could have impact on the reported sessionId for __sys__Login and __sys__Logout events.

 o r13267 __sys__Login and __sys__Logout events now return the public session id
   in the "__publicSessionId" client property as a long and the cluster wide unique
   absoluteName with "__absoluteName". The old "__sessionId" is not supported anymore.
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.LoginLogoutEvent.html

 o r13263 build.xml for C/C++:
   Added CFLAGS and LDFLAGS so one can configure C/C++ compilation and linkage
   Remove /usr/lib path for library as it is default and prevented a /usr/lib64 path on 64 bit machines

 o r13261 C/C++ port to Xeon 64 bit, added CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to build.properties
   (for example you can force 32 bit compilation on 64 bit machines with -m32 for g++)

 o r13257 Setting duplicateUpdates to deprecated, please use 'multiSubscribe'
   as described in requirement
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.qos.subscribe.multiSubscribe.html

 o r13247 Removed bug from Persistent Sessions. When a session was initially persistent
   and reconnect was specified transient, a resource leak resulted.

   Added getGlobal() and getCallback() accessors
   Added XmlBlasterAccessRef to support reference counted handling

 o r13236 C++ client library Global:
   Added GlobalRef to support reference counted handling
   Added createInstance() and destroyInstance() to handle multiple instances of Global

 o r13233 Added I_Map.remove(long uniqueId)

 o r13230 Removed bug on persistent subscriptions. Recovered persistent subscriptions where
   not removed when unsubscribing or disconnecting.


Changes for 1.0.1 [2005-02-08] r13220 "Xmas release patched"
============================================================

 o r13215 Passing AddressServer from each protocol plugin into the core to be able
   to do protocol specific decisions.
   Used for example with the AvailabilityChecker to allow LOCAL access for small runlevels
   and for future use for the Authentication/Authorization plugins to do IP specific decisions.

 o r13212-r13214 Added support to erase message instances but not the topic itself
   See http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/interface.erase.html

 o r13202 StartupTasks plugin added
   See http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/admin.startupTasks.html

   Changed to create missing directory, now supports ${} replacement
   See http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/admin.errorHandling.html

 o r13173 More detailed logging for mime XPathFilter plugin
 
 o r13168 C client library ported to HPUX 11.11 with gcc 3.4.3
    cd xmlBlaster/demo/c/socket/bin

   new select() variant.

 o r13140 Added NPE check in DbPool.java, added new select() variant in I_DbPool.java

 o r13136 Bugfix SOCKET callback driver
   Bugfix for isAlive() detection, had impact on failsave reconnect behavior
   from xmlBlaster server callback to client. Happened only when both remained alive
   on temporary network interruption (or if callback address was same) and
   only if at least one partner is running on Windows.

 o r13127 added update with open transaction to DbPool

 o r13125 added autocommit and rollback to DbPool

 o r13121 added publish to the php xmlrpc demo library

 o r13110 Added DbWatcher framework to poll for changes on databases
   and report them as XML formatted messages, see
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/contrib.dbwatcher.html

 o r13094 Added XmlBlasterJdk14LoggingHandler.java which redirects JDK 1.4
   logging to our framework.
   This may be useful for native plugins which already use JDK 1.4 logging.
   Switch redirection off with '-xmlBlaster/jdk14loggingCapture false'
   The code is load by reflection to still support JDK 1.3 runtimes.


Changes for 1.0 [2004-12-23] r13076 "Xmas release"

   content does not happen anymore 

 o C client library:
   - r12985 Added XMLBLASTER_NO_RCSID switch for broken svnversion/rcsid workaround

 o C++ client library:
   - r12985 Added XMLBLASTER_NO_RCSID switch for broken svnversion/rcsid workaround

   - r12958 duplicateUpdates defaults now to true to have identical behaviour for Java and C++
   - r12937 FreeBSD port, support for BOOST added again, thanks to Viner, David <dviner@yahoo-inc.com>
   - r12877 Added xerces initialization from main thread, as on Windows it crashed sometimes if initialized from callback thread
   - r12871 Extended clientProperty API
   - r12870 Added xerces XMLPlatformUtils::Initialize PanicHandler

     ex.getMessage()="r12702 Can't load your plugin"

 o r12703 Upgraded ANT from version 1.6.1 to version 1.6.2

 o r12696 Added org.xmlBlaster.engine.DeadMessageDumper plugin to dump
   dead messages to hard disk, supports republishing (see javadoc)

 o r12689,r12690 Added '__deadMessageReason' ClientProperty to dead messages

 o r12685,r12686 New server flag -xmlBlaster/acceptWrongSenderAddress/<subjectId>  true/false [false]
   -xmlBlaster/acceptWrongSenderAddress/joe true
    Allows user 'joe' to send a wrong sender address in PublishQos
    Useful to resend dead messages with 'javaclients.script.XmlScript'

 o r12681 Checking subscription handle to be null to avoid IllegalArgumentException
   Thanks to aaron@mindwidgets.com

 o r12665 Java client library: fail safe mode
   Remember public and secret sessionId on client side for reconnect attempts
   (For future enhancement of pubSessionId<0 and persistent sessions)

 o r12664 Java client library: Bugfix get() and async mode
   Catching get() requests in async mode and throw an exception

 o r12663 Java client library: Bugfix switch to sync mode
   Added dispatchManager.trySyncMode(true) to force immediate sync mode
   after polling even for empty client queue

 o r12662 Java client library: FEATURE refreshSession
   Added ConnectQos.refreshSession tag for automated client side session refresh
   Example: connectQos.setRefreshSession(true)

 o Changed from cvs to subversion on 2004-10-17, see
   http://subversion.tigris.org/

 o Added new property to delay xmlBlaster startup, for example
   -xmlBlaster/sleepOnStartup 5000 sets it to 5 seconds.
   Useful for example for Windows Service startup delay to wait on MSSQLServer JDBC listener

 o J2ME:
   - Ported String concat with '+' to StringBuffer.append()
   - Fixed compilation for JDK 1.5 (forcing target 1.4)

 o Added administrative access to a subscription dump for a client.
   Try something like
     java javaclients.HelloWorldSubscribe -session.name joe/1 -xpath //key
     java javaclients.HelloWorldGet -oid '__cmd:client/joe/1/?subscriptionDump'

 o Bugfix: Plugins with no package names did throw NPE

 o Plugin configuration of protocol plugins
   Fixed to check properties from plugin configuration in xmlBlaster.properties

 o Added separate links for client side Java API and complete Java API on homepage.

 o Cluster configuration change
   The xml configuration expects now a standard ConnectQos markup instead of the old
   specific <info> section. The old markup is still working but deprecated.
   See http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/interface.connect.html
   See http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/cluster.html

 o Java client API change:
   The ConnectQos constructor can now throw an XmlBlasterException if loading of
   SecurityPlugin fails

 o htpassed authentication:
   - The password files are now trimmed (leading and trailing spaces are removed)
   - We now support startWith() and endsWith() in mode 'Security.Server.Plugin.htpasswd.allowPartialUsername=true'
   - We now support '*:48fdja94jfd' entries which allow to set a wildcard password
     A matching specific user like 'joe:dfkj843f81' has precedence in password evaluation
   - Replaced StreamTokenizer code with simpler line based file read because of problems with special chars
   - Changed comments to start with '#' instead of '//'
   See: http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/security.htpasswd.html

 o Cluster support: PtP messages now use the same cluster lookup code as Pub/Sub
   and are fully cluster routing enabled.

 o Java client library:
   Changed ClientErrorHandler to not remove client side queue entries on certain exceptions

 o Bugfix in PtP cluster forwarding:
   In some cases the destination QoS got lost

 o SOCKET SSL
   Renamed configuration 'keystore' to 'keyStore' to conform to javas system property
   Renamed configuration 'keystorepassword' to 'keyStorePassword' to conform to javas system property
   Added 'trustStore' lookup on client side

 o xmlBlaster.properties.template:
   Added CbProtocolPlugin[SOCKET][1.0] and CbProtocolPlugin[socket_ssl][1.0]
   as dummy plugins. Those dummies are needed for persistent session recovery.

 o Reintroduced notify for XPATH subscriptions (they were removed in 0.91)
   NOTE: XPath subscriptions will match again if the erased topic is recreated
   Exact subscriptions are lost when a topic is explicitely erased, a subscriber
   would need to re-subscribe on a erased topic if needed.
   This is an important difference, the erase notify is essential for exact
   subscriptions so they now about the stale subscription.

 o SOCKET UDP support:
   Added paramter to switch on/off the server side UDP listener (defaults to false)
   -plugin/socket/startUdpListener true/false

 o SOCKET compression for Java server and clients added
   The compression is based on jzlib and supports 2 ways of compression
   namely 'stream based' and 'message content' based.
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/protocol.socket.html#compress
   Thanks to Bal�zs P�ka bpoka@axelero.hu

 o SOCKET SSL support for Java server and clients added, the usage is simple, see
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/protocol.socket.html#SSL
   Thanks to Bal�zs P�ka bpoka@axelero.hu
   
 o SOCKET incompatible change:
   The disconnect returns a server side ACK now (from SOCKET protocol layer).
   This is a fix of the protocol.socket requirement:
   disconnect can throw an exception and therefore it also needs to have a return value

 o SOCKET incompatible change:
   Behaviour changed on client side so that disconnect() always makes a
   shutdown even on low level exceptions

 o SOCKET java protocol plugin:
   Fixed memory leak on InterruptedIOException (very seldom case)

 o C client library:
   - r12860 Timeout.cpp: Fixed shutdown with join(); Checking class state on method calls; Added catch(...) for error handling 
   - r12858 Threading library: Added mode to start threads detached: start(bool detached)
   - r12854 Changed from winsock.h to Winsock2.h to have SD_BOTH
   - r12750 Upgrade to pthreads-dll-2004-06-22
   - r12746 Windows flag '/YX' added for precompiled headers
   - r12710 Added subversion revision number, see getXmlBlasterVersion()
   - Added zlib:stream compression support
   - Added C client API documentation with doxygen, see
     http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/doxygen/c/html/index.html
   - Changed 'ExceptionStruct: bool remote;' to type 'int' to have 4 byte struct alignment
     It crashed when called from VC7 C++ into C
   - Added a 'D' to .so/.sl/.dll shared library name for debugging version, for example "xmlBlasterClientCD.dll"
     You can switch off debugging with "c.debug=false" in build.properties => "xmlBlasterClientC.dll"
   - Changed CallbackServer again to close socket on server EOF to avoid clients thread blocking
   - Fixed handling of remote xmlBlaster server exceptions in C client library
   - We support now a debugging so/dll compilation with an added 'D' parallel to the optimized lib
   - Fixed callback ping return for SOCKET protocol

 o C++ client library:
   - r12858 Threading lib: Added mode to start threads detached: start(bool detached)
   - r12755 "user.name" is used instead of "user" to find out the default user
   - r12746 Windows flag '/YX' added for precompiled headers
   - r12743 BUGIFX: lexical_cast from string (or char*) to bool is now handled on a special implementation
   - r12711 Added subversion revision number, see Global::getRevisionNumber()
   - Fixed setting of XmlBlasterAccess::getServerNodeId()
   - Modified Log4Cplus logging:
     1. We are now forwarding all xmlBlaster.properties and command line settings to log4cplus,
        so you could configure everything in xmlBlaster.properties instead of a separate log4cplus.properties
     2. log4cplus is extended to do ${xy} variable replacement not only from environment
        but from itself as well (recursion depth is one).
   - Added zlib:stream compression support with via C SOCKET protocol plugin
   - Incompatible API change (the compiler will tell you everything - no risk!): 
      o 'class Destination' constructor expects now the new SessionName instead of SessionQos
      o updateQos.getSender()->getAbsoluteName() instead of '.' as SessionNameRef is reference counted
      o Removed namespace from header: Clients now may need to add
         using namespace org::xmlBlaster::util::qos;
   - Updated C++ client API documentation with doxygen, see
     http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/doxygen/cpp/html/index.html
   - New methods for XmlBlasterAccess: isAlive(), isPolling(), isDead()
   - SecurityQos constructor now accepts the security plugin name
   - Fixed reading of default client name
   - Fixed setting default SecurtiyQos userId from SessionName
   - Bugfix: Fixed to pass configuration settings to C-SOCKET layer on reconnect
   - Bugfix: Corrected sender name in PublishQos after reconnect and flushing queue
   - Added a 'D' to .so/.sl/.dll shared library name for debugging version, for example "xmlBlasterClientD.dll"
     You can switch off debugging with "cpp.debug=false" in build.properties => "xmlBlasterClient.dll"
   - Fixed initial queueing of connect request if xmlBlaster server is not available (ConnectQos is not queued anymore)
   - We support now a debugging so/dll compilation with an added 'D' parallel to the optimized lib
   - Changed to initialize callback address in ConnectQos only if a callback server is created
   - Changed to only install a CORBA callback server if necessary
     Thanks to pikaiyuan@163.com
   - Fixed Windows C++ compile in build.xml (unresolved externals)
     Thanks to Bjoern Ruff

   - Extended multi threading to support calling methods
     like publish() and subscribe() from within the update() callback thread.
   - Fixed C demo clients to use xmlBlasterFree() instead of free() directly
     Thanks to Martin Johnson <mjohnson@quickcut.com.au>

 o C++ client library:
   - Added UDP datagram support via SOCKET protocol, try
     java org.xmlBlaster.Main -plugin/socket/useUdpForOneway true -plugin/socket/startUdpListener true
     PublishDemo -protocol SOCKET -numPublish 5 -oneway true -plugin/socket/useUdpForOneway true
     SubscribeDemo -protocol SOCKET -updateOneway true -plugin/socket/useUdpForOneway true
     C: HelloWorldUdp -plugin/socket/useUdpForOneway true
   - Fixed publishOneway()
   - Added <updateOneway/> support to SubscribeQos
   - ClientProperty: Fixed float/double etc. assignement warning for templates
   - Removed boost source from our C++ source tree (we use omnithread)
   - Requests are now threadsafe: mutual block on requests (update thread is
     not blocked). For example a publish can not be done simultaneously as a publish on the
     same connection.
   - Fixed bug in lexical_cast for string to string on solaris
   - QueueFactory and ParserFactory are now stateless (no global nor log)
   - Bugfix in C++ client properties: empty spaces are allowed inside strings.

     cleaning up additional Global instances.

 o RMI protocol driver:
   Commented out RMI in property files, this protocol driver is currently buggy.

 o MsgUnitRaw needs to implement Serializable for RMI but may not use it for J2ME,
   this issue needs to be resolved

 o Incompatible JDBC persistence change:
   -> Removed XB_NODES table (is backward compatible)
   -> Removed XB_QUEUES table (is backward compatible)
   -> Removed column 'nodeId' from XB_ENTRIES (is NOT backward compatible)
      
      If you need to upgrade xmlBlaster having legacy data in database
      do manually a "alter table XB_ENTRIES drop column 'nodeId'".

      Otherwise just drop all old database tables
      (for HSQLDB remove its files in the tmp directory, on Windows the
       default %HOMEPATH%\tmp location for user 'joe' is
       "C:\Documents and Settings\joe\tmp"
       and on Linux "$HOME/tmp")

   Exception text is:
      [Aug 28, 2004 2:47:15 PM ERROR XmlBlaster.MainThread org.xmlBlaster.engine.msgstore.cache.PersistenceCachePlugin-topicStore:xmlBlaster_192_168_1_4_3412]

   for publishOneway() and updateOneway()
   Contributed by Michal Masa <xmasam@sgi.felk.cvut.cz>

 o Server side SOCKET plugin: Added support for multiple SOCKET plugin instances
   with separate configurations. 

 o Configuration attributes in xmlBlasterPlugin.xml are now used as
   default settings for all protocol plugins

 o Added separate statistic counter for updateOneway

 o Added updateOneway flag to SubscribeQos to control
   callback delivery for this subscription

 o Bugfix for sending ERASE events in UNREFERENCED topics with XPath subscription
   Topics delivered by XPATH subscriptions don't send erase notifications
   when they disappear as they match again if the appear again

 o XmlRpc access: Added support for message contents of type 'String' besides 'byte[]'

 o Support for JDK 1.5 by forcing source/target compilation to 1.4

 o ClientProperty: Forcing Base64 for & character in string client property

   It is now configurable for which mime types the XPath plugin takes affect, see
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/mime.plugin.access.xpath.html
   Thanks to Robert Leftwich <robert@leftwich.info>

 o SOCKET bugfix: java client did not return callback ping which resulted in a client disconnect
 
 o added missing logkit and avalon framework to distribution- and client distribution build

 o Fixed topic lifecycle: XPATH subscriptions don't
   prevent a topic from going to dead anymore
   Thanks to David Kerry <xml@navahonetworks.com>

 o Fixed xml dump to be well formed again
 
 o Fixed get() mime filter query plugin load bug
   Thanks to jlc.xmlblaster.0504@jambotech.com

     to be able to add arbitrary queue implementations as plugins.
   - Bugfix for default logging: loglevel settings inherited from I_Log
   - Bugfix reading of xmlBlaster.properties: Line extensions are now recognized
   - Extended Property class to preset ${user.home}, ${user.name},
     ${file.separator} and ${path.separator} to support replacement in xmlBlaster.properties
   - Bugfix of failsafe mode when a publish noticed connection loss before ping thread
   - Changed to activate failsafe mode even without a connectionProblem listener
     if -dispatch/connection/delay is > 0

Changes for 0.901 [2004-04-27]
==============================

 o Added persistent session and persistent subscriptions for
   revovery after server crash or server restart:
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.persistence.session.html
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.persistence.subscription.html

 o Changed synchronization of disconnecting a client which could be
   a portential dead lock if a shutdown and a client disconnect comes
   simultaneously

 o Added an 'AvailabilityChecker' to protect xmlBlaster in the different run levels.
   This is another step for enhanced maintenance modes.

 o Changed delivered Postgres SQL driver from jdbc7.2dev-1.2.jar to pg74.213.jdbc2.jar
   (renamed to postgresql.jar) wich supports PostgreSQL 7.4

 o Changed jacorb to ver. 2.1. This to eliminate a nasty bug causing an implicit redelivery of 
   messages. Moved jacorb jar files to xmlBlaster/lib/jacorb
   NOTE: You need to use the ajusted xmlBlaster/config/jacorb.properties.template
         (which is copied into xmlBlaster.jar) if you use your own jacorb.jar.
   NOTE: The name of the property jacorb.verbosity has changed to jacorb.log.default.verbosity

 o Fixed release generation to remove build.tmp and
   keep the 'build' script.

 o Bugfix in PersistentCachePlugin (I_Map, msgUnitStore)
   - swapping with ascending messages sizes could fail
     (Thanks to Dimitri.Devriendt@ses-astra.com)
   - synchronized setProperties()
     (Thanks to Dimitri.Devriendt@ses-astra.com)
   - numOfBytes calculation was buggy if swapping

 o Bugfix in JDBC service module to handle NULL db entries
   Thanks to zzwzyz@hotmail.com

 o Added two new requirements:
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/security.ldap.html

   and simultaneous login of this subject

 o Changed xmlBlaster dump to contain only legal tag names conforming
   to xml 1.0 spec (changed Property in jutils.jar).
 
 o changed ant to 1.6.1
 
 o Tested on IBM s390: Linux 2.4.19-4 SMP s390
   Java client/server, C++ and C compiles (g++ 3.2.2) and runs fine

 o AppletServlet is now processing binary data too (client class sends it 
   in the body of the request)

 o Added properties to limit the burst mode size of callback invocations:
   -dispatch/callback/burstMode/maxEntries
               The maximum bulk size of a callback invocation [-1]
               -1 takes all entries available in the callback RAM queue
               possibly limited by maxBytes
   -dispatch/callback/burstMode/maxBytes
               The maximum bulk size of a callback invocation [-1]
               -1L takes all entries available in the callback RAM queue
               possibly limited by maxEntries

 o Bugfix: C SOCKET client library, fixed uninitialized memory read in memmove call
 
 o changed the JdbcConnectionPool to be handled by Doug Lea's classes
 
 o Added Thread Name to Logs 

 o Added a demo applet with XML script access to xmlBlaster.
   Location: xmlBlaster/demo/http/applet/XmlScript.java
   Compile:  build deploy_war   (and start tomcat + xmlBlaster server)
   Load:     http://localhost:8080/xmlBlaster/XmlScript.html (in mozilla, konqueror, appletviewer, explorer)

 o Bugfix for JXPath generation of ClientProperty in QoS (impact on tiny applet example only)

 o Updated utils.jar to CVS version from  2004-03-19, contains Property bug fix for ArrayOutOfBoundsException

 o JDBC configuration: Added column name prefix, used for MS-SQLServer to
   prefix reserved DB names 'byteSize' and 'dataId', see
      colNamePrefix=XB_
   in xmlBlaster.properties.template (the prefix is internally converted to uppercase)

 o modified http.applet protocol to allow invocations from standalone apps and from j2me

 o Renamed admin access to subjectInfo getCbQueueNumMsgs to getSubjectQueueNumMsgs

 o Added ActiveX (Windows) control to support access from C# and VisualBasic.net
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.activex.html

 o Fixed to rethrow XmlBLasterException from inside SAX parsing

 o Fixed build.xml to not need -DJVM.target=1.4 for JDK 1.5

Changes for 0.9 [2004-02-23]
============================

 o Ported java code to JDK 1.5
   - As 'enum' is now (Jdk1.5) a reserved keyword we renamed our package 'enum' to 'def'
     by replacing the token '.enum.' to '.def.' in the complete source tree.
   - Compiling: build -DJVM.target=1.4 delete all

 o SOCKET protocol on Java client side:
   - Fixed exception handling from update() calls
   - Added 'virtual' callback server shutdown
   - Fixed MsgUnit[] return from get() call to be of length=0 if no message is returned
     Before the array contained one entry with empty key/qos

 o The msgStore cache implementation supports now LRU (last recently used) lookup

 o Added setter and getter for subject queue property in ConnectQos

 o Added a shuffler thread to forward entries from SubjectQueue to
   SessionQueue (to achieve Thread safety).

 o Added I_QueueSizeListener to listen to changes in size of a queue

 o Bugfix: Reconfiguration of client reconnect (same pubSessionId)
   supports now queue properties and sync/async reconfiguration
   (with or without a client side callback server)

 o Extended forceQueuing=true support for PtP messages sent to a
   specific session which does not yet exist.
   This will automatically establish a callback session queue for
   the destination

 o Added support for a sync connected client to reconnect
   in async mode (by providing a callback address).
   Sync connected clients may receive PtP messages which are
   stored in their session queue until the client reconnects
   with a callback address and the queued messages are delivered.
   Switching an async client on the fly to sync mode 
   (by reconnecting without a callback address) is currently not supported.
 
 o XmlScriptInterpreter now uses a Reader (InputStream was starting
   processing AFTER reading whole stream).
  
 o Added persistent session+subscription support in C++

 o Global.detachJdbcManagerCommonTable() removed (was obsolete)

 o The EntryFactories are now threadsafe and the Global.getEntryFactory now
   does not take any name and the factory is a singleton. EntryFactory.getName
   does not exist anymore. I_StoragePlugin.getType can be used instead
 
 o Added XmlScriptInterpreter which can execute xmlBlaster commands from an
   xml file (in a way similar to ant, maven and jelly)

 o Nested key tags are now allowed inside key
 
 o Added a new class EncodableData (ClientProperty now extends from it)
  
 o Eliminated MsgTopicErrorHandler since used nowhere

 o Changed build.xml for C and C++ compilation
   Now the source files are copied to a separate destination
   To build C or C++ do a cleanup first (before you checkout the new code):
     build c-delete
     build cpp-delete
   or remove the outdated msgUtil_CopyByAnt.c and Global_CopyByAnt.cpp files manually

 o C++ client library (Incompatible API change):
   - The update() method argument 'content' has changed from
     'void *' to 'const unsigned char *'
   - The global.getLog() method now returns the interface I_Log (an abstract class)
     to the logging framework instead of the Log.cpp implementation itself.
     This allows to plug in your own logging framework

 o C++ client library:
   - xmlBlaster.properties is read (-propertyFile ... or in $HOME or in $XMLBLASTER_HOME)
   - Added native SOCKET protocol plugin based on the C-client library
   - Added logging abstraction interface to support different logging implementations
   - Added log4cplus 1.0.1 logging library to xmlBlaster distribution
     see http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net (Apache license)
   - Fixed command line usage, try 'HelloWorld2 -help'
   - Fixed memory leak for some XmlBlasterExceptions thrown
   - Logging cleanup (switchable xterm colors)
   - Added Global::getCompiler()
   - Fixed LifeTimeManager to have destruction sequence reversed to creation sequence
   - Added map to LifeTimeManager to support registered object lookup by key
   - Bugfix for lexical_cast<double> and lexical_cast<long double>
     which rounded to only 6 digits
   - Added Base64 support for ClientProperty
   - Bugfix: SAX parsers are now thread safe
   - Renamed msgQosData.getForceDestroy() to isForceDestroy()
   - Other minor changes

 o C-client library:
   Fixed to return secretSessionId in update() method
   Fixed to return isOneway in update() method
   Fixed get() return without a match
   Renamed xmlBlasterAccess->userData to userObject to avoid ambiguity

 o C-client library (Incompatible API change):
   - Fixed unSubscribe() and erase() to return now 'QosArr *' instead
     of 'char *'.
   - ping() now wants a third argument 'xmlBlasterException*'
   - Added user specific object to be returned to the logging callback (logUserP)
   See xmlBlaster/demo/c/socket/HelloWorld3.c for a usage example.

 o Renamed build.sh to build. Now on UNIX and Windows the build command is the same,
   for example 'build all', note that you have to manually delete the old 'build'
   directory

 o Fixed dead messages "__sys__deadMessage" to contain the complete key and qos
   of its embedded message.
   The clientProperty keys are "__key", "__qos", "__oid" and "__rcvTimestamp".
   The latter two are added for convenience reasons only.

 o Extended ClientProperties to transfer blob data, introduced base64
   encoding if illegal characters are transferred
   see http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.qos.clientProperty.html

 o Added protection for publisher thread to never do cleanup of callbacks
   (avoid dead locks)

 o manifest.xmlBlaster: Added missing jhotdraw.jar, demo.jar and testsuite.jar

 o C-client: changed include in pthread.h for simpler compilation

 o Corrected spelling from <subscribeable> to <subscribable>

 o Fixed update problem when content is empty

 o Fixed dead letter handling on callback queue overflow

 o C-client library: Fixed bug in trim() which lead on stress tests
   to corrupted messages.
   Thanks to FdGiglio@naples.sema.slb.com

 o JDK 1.2 runtime support: The current jacorb.jar does NOT run with JDK 1.2
   To run xmlBlaster with JDK 1.2 you have these options:
   - Download an older jacorb.jar and throw it into xmlBlaster/lib
   or
   - Switch off the corba plugin in xmlBlasterPlugins.xml, now the
     server runs fine. For java clients use the SOCKET
     protocol with the option '-protocol SOCKET' (RMI and XML-RPC are fine too).
   
   NOTE: You can compile xmlBlaster with JDK 1.3 (or 1.4) and still
   run it with JDK 1.2. If you need to compile xmlBlaster with JDK 1.2
   please exclude the JMX stuff in build.xml (uncomment those):
      <patternset id="jdk12.notcompatible.sources">
         <exclude name="**/jmx/**"/>
         <exclude name="**/jmxgui/**"/>
         <exclude name="**/memoryleak/**"/>
      </patternset>
   build.sh delete; build.sh xmlBlaster
   (Parts of the testsuite won't compile with JDK 1.2)

 o Fixed hsqldb.jar to compile/run with JDK 1.3 and 1.2 again.

 o Fixed dead message loop if a dead message subscriber subscribed
   on other messages as well and than crashed.

 o Fixed synchronization gap on client login,
   SubjectInfo registered before it was fully initialized
   Thanks to Dimitri Devriendt his detailed report.

 o C++ client library:
   Created an abstract xml layer to allow to easily implement other xml parsers than xerces

 o Changed the Subscribeable flag to Subscribable

 o Updated LDAP authentication demo, see
     xmlBlaster/demo/ldap/README

 o ConnectQos: 
   - Renamed setSecurityPluginData() to loadClientPlugin()
   - Renamed I_ClientPlugin.getSecurityQos() to createSecurityQos()
   - Removed setSecurityInterceptor() and getSecurityInterceptor()
   - Removed getSecurityPluginType() and getSecurityPluginVersion() and setSecurityQos()

 o C++ client: Ported to multi threaded Corba mico 2.3.11

 o Added a new ant task 'javadocs-client' which only creates the Java client
   side API documentation.

 o Added tiny Applet which supports asynchronous callbacks using
   a persistent http connection, see
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.java.applet.html
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.browser.html

 o Moved HelloWorld*.java examples to directory xmlBlaster/demo to
   avoid package name problems

 o QosData: embedded each client property with CDATA (java and c++)

 o Fixed mouse sensitive area in chessRhino.svg


Changes for 0.85e (beta) [2003-10-31]
=====================================

 o Ported C client library to OSF1 V5.1 1885 alpha
   Thanks to FdGiglio@naples.sema.slb.com

 o Cluster: Fixed that protocol settings for embeded cluster clients are respected
   (The setting CREATED_BY_SETTER is now enforced to be stronger than env settings)

 o XmlBlaster cluster now support unSubscribe() routing

 o Changed subscription ID to be cluster wide unique

 o Bugfix cluster setup: Catching forever looping PtP messages
   in a clustered environment

 o Bugfix for corrupted PublishQos, occurring
   since 0.85c

 o Added publish QoS sender name check (authentication) to avoid spoofing

 o added multiple ConnectionStatusListeners to DispatchManager

 o changed nomenclature from 'Delivery' to 'Dispatch' to avoid confusion.
   Need to take the new xmlBlaster.properties
 
Changes for 0.85d (beta) [2003-10-12]
=====================================

 o Bugfix which randomly threw IllegalStateException, occurring
   since 0.85c

 o Fixed C client library bugs (memmove, zero msg payload and
   possible thread lock gap) see
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.c.socket.html

 o Added type to client properties in qos
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/interface.publish.html

 o Some more work is done on the JMS Java client library, see
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/jms.html


Changes for 0.85c (beta) [2003-10-05]
=====================================

 o Bugfix for queueing PtP messages when there are session which have
   set isPtpAllowed==false

 o Fixed to not put none subscribable PtP messages to the history queue

 o Added limited support to reconfigure a subject queue
   from CACHE to RAM during operation.

 o Fixed internal error dump when expired history entry
   is subscribed.

 o XmlBlasterException now dumps an online URL with
   detailed informations.
   Please use new xmlBlaster.properties.template

 o Protected core authentication against unwanted access by
   plugin developers and native client developers, see
   AuthenticateProtector.java, SubjectInfoProtector.java, SessionInfoProtector.java

 o Bugfix for queue plugin configuration transport in QoS, e.g.
     -queue/connection/defaultPlugin RAM,1.0

 o Fixed client side thread demand by implementing
   lazy instantiation. This for example reduces the 
   number of xmlBlaster specific threads from 5 to 1 for
   a Java SOCKET connection.

 o Fixed possible thread leak in java client library
   when using many client connections and Global is not
   garbage collected frequently enough by the JVM

 o Updated Perl support, see
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.perl.html

 o Bugfix for topics with a destroy delay of 0 msec.
   Reported by Dominique Petitpierre


Changes for 0.85beta [2003-09-24]
=================================

 o Changed all getBytes to getBinaryStream in JdbcManagerCommonTable and changed
   signature of I_EntryFactory.createEntry
   to take an input stream (due to problems with Oracle 9i and BLOB)

 o Changed default type for Oracle to BLOB (since RAW LONG is deprecated in 9i).
   Max Blob size is 4GB

 o Added a Key and Qos cache for publish (the literal is the key and the Data is the value)
   -> 15 % better performance

 o Added clientProperty tag to most of the qos (only StatusQos don't have it)

 o Added support to set and lookup the engine.Global (via GlobalUtil) for the j2ee components.

 o Finished the LOCAL protocol.

 o Added flag enableBatchMode in the jdbc queue plugins

 o added storage of blob in DummyEntry (before it was a fictive size,
   now its complete size is stored/retrieved from the DB).

 o Moved to JacORB 2.0 beta 2 + (cvs) from 2003-09-14 15:00
   You can check out this version with:
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.jacorb.org/cvsroot/jacorb checkout -D '2003-09-14 15:00' JacORB
   idl.jar is patched to contain JacORB/lib/logkit.jar

 o Updated XPathFilter to support Jaxen XPath extension functions,
   also added the functions RecursiveTextFunction and ContainsIgnoreCaseFunction.

 o Updated j2ee components to the latest API changes.
   Also fixed property handling so that xmlBlaster.properties is not loaded by default.
   xmlBlaster.properties and xmlBlasterPlugins.xml is removed from the xmlBlaster.jar
   to not upset the propertyloading.

 o Changed ClassLoaderFactory to be interface based, now pluggable with property classLoaderFactory.
   Moved implementing ClassLoaderFactory to StandaloneClassLoaderFactory and
   added a ContextClassLoaderFactory to be used in certain embedded environments.

 o Bugfix in Timeout.java
   - userData is now correctly passed
   - addOrRefreshTimeoutListener() acts now correctly on all situations
   Reported by Xavier Roques, xRoques@infovista.com

 o Ported chess demo to batik 1.5, cleanup of event queue

 o Moved getJdbcQueueManagerCommonTable from util.Global to JdbcQueueCommonTablePlugin so that the 
   manager is not referenced outside the plugin it serves. Moved also wipeOutDB from Global to the
   queue plugin).

 o Property loading cleanup in Global.java 
   Thanks to Peter Antman for the discussion

 o Fixed build.xml 'dist' task to include HSQLDB

 o Bugfix in persistence layer for huge messages.
   Reported by pikaiyuan

 o The jmxgui now uses only one XmlBlasterAccess to communicate with xmlBlaster

 o fix in JdbcQueueManager to avoid batch mode invocations if the DB does not 
   support this feature (particularly for hsqldb)

 o The SVG Javascript chess example is updated to this
   new release with some bugfixes, see
     http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.javascript.rhino.html

 o Bugfix Java client library:
   In fail safe mode on client reconnect the subscribe
   specific callback redirect got lost and updates where
   delivered to the default callback handle.
   (The bug was introduced in 0.849 when fixing a memory leak).

 o Removed deprecated classes from package org.xmlBlaster.client:
      EraseKeyWrapper.java
      EraseQosWrapper.java
      GetKeyWrapper.java
      GetQosWrapper.java
      PublishKeyWrapper.java
      PublishQosWrapper.java
      SubscribeKeyWrapper.java
      SubscribeQosWrapper.java
      UnSubscribeKeyWrapper.java
      UnSubscribeQosWrapper.java
      EraseRetQos.java
      I_RetQos.java
      PublishRetQos.java
      SubscribeRetQos.java
      UpdateKey.java
      UpdateQos.java
      GetQos.java
   Please use the packages org.xmlBlaster.client.key and
   org.xmlBlaster.client.qos instead
   
 o Fixed build.bat to take more command line parameters

 o Added new connect QoS setting 'reconnectSameClientOnly' which
   allows us to enforce a client singleton - if you need to assure
   that a client can only connect exactly once, see
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/interface.connect.html
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.configuration.html

 o Exhaust of maxSessions throws now ErrorCode.USER_CONFIGURATION_MAXSESSION

 o JAVA client: Calling xmlBlasterAccess.connect() multiple times without disconnect()
   throws now ErrorCode.USER_CONNECT_MULTIPLE

 o Removed deprecated 
    org.xmlBlaster.util.ConnectQos
    org.xmlBlaster.util.ConnectReturnQos
    org.xmlBlaster.util.DisconnectQos
   please use siblings from package org.xmlBlaster.client.qos

Changes for 0.849 [2003-07-15]
==============================

 o Bugfix Java client library: Fixed memory leak for reconnecting clients with
  subscribes using specific callbacks. 

 o Changed behavior that '-version' and '-type' is not read from env anymore,
   only the more qualified variants like '-queue/connection/version'

 o Fixed HSQLDB plugin to create a seperate DB instance for each
   client or server instance in directory ${user.home}/tmp

 o Added Property replacement variant $_{XYZ} which does NOT throw an
   exception if XYZ is not found

 o C++: Added first code to embedd C SOCKET lib as a C++ protocol plugin,
   see COMPILE_SOCKET_PLUGIN and COMPILE_CORBA_PLUGIN switches in build.xml

 o C++: Removed ALl 'using namespace' declarations from C++ header files.

 o Implemented hsqldb as the embedded database. Persistence is now supported per
   default
 
 o Added C wrapper to embedd C tests into JUnit testing, try
     build.sh total
     build.sh runTestsAndReport
   which creates a report:
     http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/test/report/html/index.html

 o Removed a2Blaster (for authentication/authorization).
   The a2Blaster project is developed further commercially and like
   this of no use for us.

 o Removed complete Xindice support as the persistence layer changed.
   To add Xindice again it needs to implement the persistent queue framework, see
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.html

 o Removed outdated and UNIX only jacorb.sh java_orbacus.sh  mico.sh orbacus.sh
   They where mainly used for Makefiles

 o Removed all Makefiles, please use now 'ant' and 'build.xml'
   NOTE: xmlBlaster/config/xmlBlaster-autoconf.tar.gz still exists
         but probably needs a face lift.

 o Bugfix in cluster configuration, switch off naming service and
   setting other address parameters is now possible from configuration file.
   Reported by Michael Atighetchi.

 o Bugfix clustering for get() by Michael Atighetchi.
   A node X was only forwarding get requests to other nodes if a subscription
   has been established to X and a message had been successfully served to that
   subscription. Now, get() requests are always forwarded to the right other nodes.

 o Added MethodName argument to exportMessage in security message interceptor

 o Zhang Zhi Wei added a Microsoft SQL Server port for our persistence layer
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.sqlserver.html

 o Completed ANSI-C client library for sync and async xmlBlaster access:
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.c.socket.html

 o Added support for OmniORB 4.0.1 (C++ client library)

 o Bugfix C++ object cleanup by Martin Johnson

 o Removed deprecated property scanning precedence, see PropEnv.java

 o Bugfix to report nicer wrong configuration setting

 o Bugfix  '-pluginsFile /yourdirectory/yourfile.xml' works now
   as expected


Changes for 0.848 [23, May 2003]
================================
 o Fix in XmlBlasterException for MakeFormat with index > {9}
   IBM JDK 1.3.1 can't handle it (i believe 1.4 handles it now).

 o Changed protocol plugin loading behavior.
   Now we throw an exception if the protocol plugin is not found
   instead of choosing the default protocol as fallback.
 
 o Updated requirements

 o Incompatible changes (update xmlBlaster.properties and xmlBlasterPlugins.xml):

   1. Removed XmlBlasterConnection.java, please use XmlBlasterAccess.java
      Removed I_ConnectionProblems.java, please use I_ConnectionStateListener.java

   2. XmlBlasterAccess.initCbServer(String loginName, String type, String version) -> initCbServer(String loginName, CallbackAddress cbAddress)

   3. Protocol "XML-RPC" renamed to "XMLRPC"
      -> client server communication will not work between this
         and the previous release.

   4. The protocol address is now configurable with Address.java/CallbackAddress.java
      with the method 
         public void setPluginProperty(String key, String value);
      or the old way with glob.setProperty()
      AddressBase.java is redesigned, please check the javadoc.
      Further you can hardcode a destination host directly with e.g.
        address.setType("XMLRPC");
        address.setRawAddress("http://192.168.2.5:9955/");

   5. Renamed property to new schema, try
         java org.xmlBlaster.Main -help     (server side usage)
         java HelloWorld3 -help             (client side usage)
      These replacements where made:
      hostname                -> bootstrapHostname
      port                    -> bootstrapPort
      socket.port             -> dispatch/connection/plugin/socket/port
      socket.hostname         -> dispatch/connection/plugin/socket/hostname
      socket.cb.multiThreaded -> dispatch/connection/plugin/socket/multiThreaded
      socket.threadPrio       -> dispatch/connection/plugin/socket/threadPrio
      socket.responseTimeout  -> dispatch/connection/plugin/socket/responseTimeout
      socket.responseTimeout  -> plugin/socket/responseTimeout  (server)
      ns                      -> dispatch/connection/plugin/ior/useNameService
      ns                      -> plugin/ior/useNameService  (server)
      ior                     -> dispatch/callback/plugin/ior/iorString
      ior                     -> dispatch/connection/plugin/ior/iorString
      ior                     -> plugin/ior/iorString  (server)
      ior.file                -> dispatch/connection/plugin/ior/iorFile
      ior.portCB              -> dispatch/callback/plugin/ior/port
      ior.hostnameCB          -> dispatch/callback/plugin/ior/hostname
      ior.port                -> dispatch/connection/plugin/ior/port
      ior.port                -> plugin/ior/port  (server)
      ior.hostname            -> dispatch/connection/plugin/ior/hostname
      ior.hostname            -> plugin/ior/hostname (server)
      xmlrpc.port             -> dispatch/connection/plugin/xmlrpc/port
      xmlrpc.hostname         -> dispatch/connection/plugin/xmlrpc/hostname
      xmlrpc.portCB           -> dispatch/callback/plugin/xmlrpc/port
      xmlrpc.hostnameCB       -> dispatch/callback/plugin/xmlrpc/hostname
      iorHost                 -> hostname
      iorPort                 -> port           (3411)
      rmi.registryPortCB      -> dispatch/callback/plugin/rmi/registryPort
      rmi.registryPort        -> dispatch/connection/plugin/rmi/registryPort
      rmi.AuthServer.url      -> dispatch/connection/plugin/rmi/AuthServerUrl
   
   6. The ConnectQos xml markup changed from
        <address ... hostname='...' port='...'>
      to
        <address ... bootstrapHostname='...' bootstrapPort='...'>
   
   7. Please copy the new config/xmlBlaster.properties.template
         to $HOME/xmlBlaster.properties
      Please copy the new config/xmlBlasterPlugins.xml.template
         to $HOME/xmlBlasterPlugins.xml

 o Bugfix: Server side command line usage was showing client side usage as well

 o BUGIFX: PropBoolean had wrong Boolean to boolean conversion

 o Bugfix Perl: Outdated sessionId markup in ConnectQos,
   fixed by Dominique.Petitpierre@adm.unige.ch 

 o Bugfix C-XmlRpc: Added missing ping(), reported by
   Dominique.Petitpierre@adm.unige.ch 

 o Added basic support to connect to xmlBlaster from
   simple C with SOCKET protocol, see
   xmlBlaster/src/c/README

 o Changed socket protocol parser to be more tolerant
   on partial messages (needed for C SOCKET client).
   This change is backward compatible.

 o Added MethodName argument to I_MsgSecurityInterceptor.importMessage
   to allow for creation of MsgUnit from MsgUnitRaw within security plugins

Changes for 0.847 [12, May 2003]
================================

 o Michele Laghi added a graphic chat demo using xmlBlaster.
   It can be used for example to discuss designs and the
   remote participants drawings are instantly copied to the other
   users. See xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/graphical/README

 o Added Martin's managed objects in the c++ clients 

 o Java client library interface change, removed method
   boolean disconnect(DisconnectQos disconnectQos, boolean clearClientQueue, boolean shutdown, boolean shutdownCb) 
   Please configure the options in DisconnectQos and use disconnect(DisconnectQos)

 o Bugfix in java client library. If the client side tail back queue contains
   persistent entries on disconnect they are kept and resent on new connection
   of the same client (same pubSessionId).
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/interface.disconnect.html

 o Merged basic JMX support from branch jmx_gui

 o Bugfix: PersistentStore and PersistentQueue have now separate pools. Avoids
   deadlocks when configured with only 1 connection AND msg store AND
   other queues are peeking objects from persistence (for example when both caching).

 o JdbcConnectionPool works now with wait/notify instead of sleep/interrupt

 o Better exception handling in JdbcManagerCommonTable to catch even 
   throwables

 o Bugfix: Fixed subject id to be without public sessionId in all cases.
   Had severe impact on PtP messages as subject queue name was sometimes
   identical to session queue name.

 o Fixed memory leak in JDBC layer (clear SQLWarnings)
   Has impact on persistent messages only

Changes for 0.846 [26, Apr 2003]
================================

 o Enhanced Python support added by Peter <spex66@gmx.net>
   See xmlBlaster/src/python/README

 o The plugin overview:
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/MessageFlowPubSubOverview.html

 o Bugfix: sync gap in SubjectInfo.java for PtP messages and offline clients

 o removed I_Queue.take methods
 
 o removed JdbcQueuePlugin. Now only JdbcQueueCommonTablePlugin available. This was
   necessary since maintenance of double code became prohibitive.

 o I_Queue.removeRandom now returns boolean[]

 o CacheQueueInterceptorPlugin synch is now less detailed but more simple
 
 o Bugfix: deleteAllTransient does only delete own entries 
 
 o Bugfix: inconsistency between cached numOfEntries and numOfBytes on jdbc fixed

 o http push example updated to be functional for this release

 o Fixed and updated cluster demo

 o Bugfix: Setting ORB environment for different orb instances

 o Bugfix: In CORBA NameService lookup

 o Bugfix: Fixed two synchronize gaps which could lead to
   "The timeout handle is null, no timeout refresh done" exception

 o Bugfix: Fixed TopicHandler.java synchronize bug which could lead
   to multiple initial XPATH subscriptions instead of one.

 o NEW FEATURE: A subscriber can supress to receive topic ERASE
   events on topics which are erased and on which he has subscribed,
   see SubscribeQos.setWantNotify(boolean)
  
 o Bugfix for SOCKET and RMI protocol when on client startup the xmlBlaster server
   was missing. Reported by Xavier Roques <xRoques@infovista.com>

 o Changed REQ: The successful callback does not refresh a session, see:
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.qos.login.session.html

 o BugfixES in CACHE and JDBC plugins when persistent storage failed

 o BUGIFX for passing EraseReturnQos in cluster environment back to client

 o Cleanup of testsuite to avoid memory leaks during tests

 o The client side synchronous access cache is ported and
   does now automatically remove outdated entries, see:
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.cache.html

 o Cleanup of client side protocol plugin interface

 o Incompatible change in java client library:
    reachedAlive(ConnectionStateEnum oldState, I_ConnectionHandler connection) -> 
    reachedAlive(ConnectionStateEnum oldState, I_XmlBlasterAccess connection)
    
    reachedPolling(ConnectionStateEnum oldState, I_ConnectionHandler connection) ->
    reachedPolling(ConnectionStateEnum oldState, I_XmlBlasterAccess connection)
    
    reachedDead(ConnectionStateEnum oldState, I_XmlBlasterAccess connection) ->
    reachedDead(ConnectionStateEnum oldState, I_XmlBlasterAccess connection)

Changes for 0.845 [Mar, 27 2003]
===============================

 o Redesigned, powerful runlevel manager which loads plugins as
   described in xmlBlasterPlugins.xml, see
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.runlevel.html

 o New client side configuration guide
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.configuration.html

 o Updated JacORB to 1.4.50, cvs from 2003-03-279
   to get fixed orb.shutdown().

 o Memory leak Bugfix in corba protocol plugin.
   This occurred on shutdown of the corba plugin
   (e.g. if server is run embedded).

 o This release is not backward compatible.

 o One big step further to unify the command line properties, try
     java HelloWorld2 -help

 o Embedded queue framework into Java client library.
   Please port your code, typical changes you should make are:
      org.xmlBlaster.client.protocol.XmlBlasterConnection ->  org.xmlBlaster.client.I_XmlBlasterAccess
      XmlBlasterConnection.usage()   ->  System.out.println(glob.usage())
      new XmlBlasterConnection(glob) ->  glob.getXmlBlasterAccess()  
      XmlBlasterConnection           ->  I_XmlBlasterAccess
   If you use fail safe clients:
      import org.xmlBlaster.util.dispatch.ConnectionStateEnum;
      import org.xmlBlaster.client.I_ConnectionHandler;
      I_ConnectionProblems  ->  I_ConnectionStateListener
        reConnected()       ->    reachedAlive(ConnectionStateEnum oldState, I_XmlBlasterAccess connection)
        lostConnection()    ->    reachedPolling(ConnectionStateEnum oldState, I_XmlBlasterAccess connection)
                            ->    reachedDead(ConnectionStateEnum oldState, I_XmlBlasterAccess connection)
      con.initFailSave(...  ->  con.registerConnectionListener(...

   NOTE: If you use mutliple clients to connect to xmlBlaster
         you need a seperate util.Global instance for each of them (see HelloWorld5 example).
           Global globAnother = this.glob.getClone(null);
           globAnother.getXmlBlasterAccess()

   NOTE: Please copy the new config/xmlBlaster.properties.template
         to $HOME/xmlBlaster.properties

 o Fixed behavior and error handling of PtP messages, see
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.qos.publish.destination.offline.html

   new xmlBlaster release.

 o Added subscription informations to administration interface

 o Bugfix of cursor leak in jdbc persistence

 o Bugfix with missing ResultSet in return of JDBC service driver

   on new created topic: Received no initial update for post topics.
   Reported by Heinrich

 o QoS Bugfix: subscribing <local>false</local> was broken,
   the fix is checked with
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/testsuite/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/test/qos/TestSubNoLocal.java.html

 o Extended server dump information

 o Bugfix in Timeout.java: Closed synchronization gap -
   could cause a timeout event to be delayed until another fires

 o Bugfix for duplicate table names in postgres.

 o Bugfix in persistent layer for Oracle, blobs where limited to 2000 bytes,
   now they correctly process up to 2 GByte messages.

 o Finished C++ client library fow Windows/Linux with CORBA (TAO and MICO)
   Support for ORBIX on SunOS
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.cpp.html

   some circumstances

 o Bugfix: C++ testsuite runs now again

 o Other small changes


Changes for 0.84 [Jan, 22 2003]
===============================
 o Renamed <isClusterNode/> to <clusterNode/> in connect Qos

 o There is new support to publish an administrative message
   to configure a topic with QoS markup <administrative/>
      http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/interface.publish.html

 o Switched off old style persistency (XIndice, FileDriver)
   Is now handled with new persitence framework based on I_Queue.java and I_Map.java
   Backend plugins for RAM based, CACHE based and JDBC (Postgres+Oracle) based behaviour are available.

 o The environment setting -loginName is not supported anymore
   please use -session.name instead.
   The default login name is now the login name of user of the operating system

 o Package changes
   org.xmlBlaster.util.ConnectQos -> org.xmlBlaster.client.qos.ConnectQos
   org.xmlBlaster.util.ConnectReturnQos -> org.xmlBlaster.client.qos.ConnectReturnQos

 o Bugfix for UserList event message, now the
   correct users are returned

 o Update QoS markup change:
      <subscriptionId>__subId:1</subscriptionId>

      <subscribe id='__subId:1'/>
   to be compatible with other QoS.
   PtP messages are marked with '__subId:PtP'

 o Fixed many memory leaks with new queue/msgstore framework

 o Bugfix for broken returned subscriptionID

 o Added configuration option to delay deletion of a topic.
   As a default a topic is deleted 60 sec delayed after reaching
   state UNREFERENCED. This is for better performance (e.g. not reparsing
   the DOM tree) for volatile messages (e.g. for dead messages).
   See <topic destroyDelay='60000'/>
      http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.message.lifecycle.html

 o Added configuration option to suppress DOM entry of a topic.
   This topic is then invisible to XPATH and better performing (e.g. for PtP messages)
   See <topic createDomEntry='false'/>

 o __sys__UserList event messages have changed the format.
   The clients are now separated by ',' and not '\n' anymore
   to conform to the administative format.

 o Package structure change:
   org.xmlBlaster.engine.helper.Address -> org.xmlBlaster.util.qos.address.Address
   org.xmlBlaster.engine.helper.AddressBase -> org.xmlBlaster.util.qos.address.AddressBase
   org.xmlBlaster.engine.helper.CallbackAddress -> org.xmlBlaster.util.qos.address.CallbackAddress
   org.xmlBlaster.engine.helper.Destination -> org.xmlBlaster.util.qos.address.Destination
   org.xmlBlaster.engine.helper.ServerRef -> org.xmlBlaster.util.qos.address.ServerRef
   org.xmlBlaster.engine.helper.CbQueueProperty -> org.xmlBlaster.util.qos.storage.CbQueueProperty
   org.xmlBlaster.engine.helper.HistoryQueueProperty -> org.xmlBlaster.util.qos.storage.HistoryQueueProperty
   org.xmlBlaster.engine.helper.QueueProperty -> org.xmlBlaster.util.qos.storage.QueueProperty
   org.xmlBlaster.engine.helper.QueuePropertyBase -> org.xmlBlaster.util.qos.storage.QueuePropertyBase
   org.xmlBlaster.engine.helper.TopicCahceProperty -> org.xmlBlaster.util.qos.storage.MsgUnitStoreProperty
   org.xmlBlaster.engine.helper.AccessFilterQos -> org.xmlBlaster.util.qos.storage.AccessFilterQos

 o Perl: Renamed MessageUnit to MsgUnit (to be similar to Java)

 o <readonly/> is now an attribute of the qos-topic tag.

 o PtP messages are now subscribable as well.
   So take care which keyOid you choose for PtP messages.
   In past releases PtP messages were completely invisible for subscribes.
   Use <subscribable>false</subscribable> to make PtP messages invisible for subscribers.

 o Renamed
      org.xmlBlaster.engine.helper.MessageUnit
   to
      org.xmlBlaster.util.MsgUnit

 o Introduced SessionName.java for unified naming of clients, see
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.failsafe.html

 o TODO: Helma-XmlRpc throws XmlBlasterException.toString() back
   to the client, many informations are missing.
   We need to create a temporary exception which returns from toString()
   the complete XmlBlasterException XML dump, and on client
   side a XML parser which parses it back to the original XmlBlasterException

 o CORBA xmlBlaster.idl incompatible change:
   - The XmlBlasterException struct is extended with new attributes
   - The unSubscribe() method now returns a string[] instead of void

 o SOCKET protocol extension:
   The XmlBlasterException transports in the content
   the complete exception information.
   See XmlBlasterException.java toByteArr() for the serialization syntax.

 o SOCKET protocol incompatible change:
   unSubscribe returns now a String[] instead of a String

 o The xmlBlaster.properties entry "JdbcDriver.drivers" now expects
   a ":" instead of "," as a seperator

 o Administrative interface for messages:
   Added support to transport the value to set in the message
   content instead of being forced to provide it in the key oid

 o For plugin writers:
   xmlKey.isInternalMsg() changed to xmlKey.isInternal()
   to be consistent with client side naming.

 o Mime access plugin interface behaviour changed:
   When the plugin throws an exception this is not routed back to
   the publisher anymore but produces a dead letter instead.
   See javadoc of org.xmlBlaster.engine.mime.I_AccessFilter#match()

 o Added listener framework for queue put() events (events when somebody
   puts something into the queue).
   This allows synchronous method invocation over the I_Queue interface
   which is needed on client side in normal operation.
   On error we just need to unregister the put listener and the
   queueing is activated

 o Changed error behaviour for callback invocations (from subscribes):
   - Any error during callback will cause a I_MsgErrorHandler invocation
   - Now also problems before the message is put into the callback queue
     and exceptions from the access filter plugin are handled like this

 o Bugfix: ConcurrentModificationException in MsgUnitHandler 
   is resolved by not working on the Iterator directly any more

 o Added redesigned framework seperating the QoS data from
   the parser.
   This allows:
    * Using other formats than XML (e.g. serialized objects)
    * Tranporting the same QoS object for publish(), update() and get()-returns
   Incompatible client Key changes (Java):
    * client.PublishKeyWrapper     -> client.key.PublishKey
    * client.SubscribeKeyWrapper   -> client.key.SubscribeKey
    * client.SubscribeKeyWrapper   -> client.key.UnSubscribeKey
    * client.GetKeyWrapper         -> client.key.GetKey
    * client.EraseKeyWrapper       -> client.key.EraseKey
    * client.UpdateKeyWrapper      -> client.key.UpdateKey
   Incompatible client QoS changes (Java):
    * client.PublishQosWrapper     -> client.qos.PublishQos
    * client.PublishRetWrapper     -> client.qos.PublishReturnQos
    * client.UpdateQos             -> client.qos.UpdateQos
    * ---                          -> client.qos.UpdateReturnQos
    * client.GetQosWrapper         -> client.qos.GetQos
    * ---                          -> client.qos.GetReturnQos
    * client.SubscribeQosWrapper   -> client.qos.SubscribeQos
    * client.SubscribeRetQos       -> client.qos.SubscribeReturnQos
    * client.UnSubscribeQosWrapper -> client.qos.UnSubscribeQos
    * ---                          -> client.qos.UnSubscribeReturnQos
    * client.EraseQosWrapper       -> client.qos.EraseQos
    * client.EraseRetQos           -> client.qos.EraseReturnQos
   Incompatible client changes (Perl):
    * EraseRetQos.pm               -> EraseReturnQos.pm
    * PublishRetQos.pm;            -> PublishReturnQos.pm
   Incompatible subscribe XML QoS change for forced subscriptionId:
    *  <qos><subscribe id='__subId:1'/></qos>

 o Made key/content/qos in MsgUnit.java private,
   use the corresponding get() methods to access the data.
   The MsgUnit object is now immutable

 o Added MsgErrorHandler.java as a central point of error handling
   for lost messages

 o Replaced package engine.queue by a plugin framework util.queue

 o Removed ONOVERFLOW_BLOCK (it caused deadlock)
 
 o Removed XmlBlasterProperty.java and Log.java (they where deprecated)
   Use glob.getProperty() and glob.getLog(null) instead

 o Renamed deadLetter to deadMessage as proposed by Adam Williams

 o Removed deprecated login/logout in RMI drivers


Changes for 0.8+ [Nov, 25 2002]
=====================================

    message is in a callback queue and the client disappears silently
    Reported by David Kerry
    Further volatile bug fixes by David Kerry and Russell Chan
  
  - Bugfix in SOCKET protocol to ignore InterruptedException
    from other code

  - Bugfix for isVolatile message (synchronize problem)
    Reported by Russell Chan and David Kerry

  - Michele added speech output to our chat demo

  - Corrected batik.jar in manifest.xmlBlaster

  - Peter Antman add XPath mime plugin which allows
    message filtering of mime type XML (xml is in the content)
    with XPath.

  - Renamed <isDurable> tag to <persistent> to be prepared for
    o persistent Sessions
    o persistent Subscriptions
    o persistent Topics


Changes for 0.80 [Sep, 25 2002]
===============================

  - New client feature matrix by Michele Laghi, see
      http://www.xmlblaster.org/FeatureMatrix.html

  - J2EE support updated by Peter Antman
    Integration example with JBoss 3.x series
    See
      http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/j2ee.k2.html
      http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/j2ee.jmx.html

  - Added possibility to specify the subscriptionId on client side, see
      http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.qos.subscribe.id.html

  - Bugifx in Timeout class:
    On seldom occasions the addTimeoutListener() was faster than
    the run() of the Timer thread -> ignoring the timeout!
    Now the timer constructor blocks until the timer thread is up
    and ready.

  - Added build targets for documentation, e.g.
      build.sh docs
   generates javadoc, a html representation of each source file
   and all requirement html pages from xml

  - Changed testsuite directory structure

  - SOCKET protocol
    * The protocol specification changed to allow SOCKET messages without a
      MsgUnit
    * Bugfix: Distinguish between empty get() return and empty QoS as
      update return
    * Bugfix: Fail save mode of SOCKET did not callback client
      Reported by Sebastian Sturm
    * Bugfix: Message where sometimes corrupted, during writing one message
      another mixed enbetween. Fixed with synchronize.
      Reported by Antti Jarvinen
    * Bugfix for blocking recursive remote invocations
      e.g. call publish() in update() body
      This is solved with a Thread per request approach on client side
    * Bugfix: Avoid blocking client thread on lost connection waiting
      for return value (freePendingThreads())
    * Bugfix: Callback memory leak in disconnect fixed

  - Renamed ServerThread.java -> EmbeddedXmlBlaster.java

  - New ClassLoader 'XmlBlasterClassloader', which isolates the xmlBlaster from
    user environment.
    This feature is usable by integrating the org.xmlBlaster.util.EmbeddedXmlBlaster
    in another application.
    Added by Heinrich Goetzger, Konrad Krafft and Marcel Ruff, see
      http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/util.classloader.XmlBlasterClassLoader.html 
      http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/util.classloader.ClassLoaderFactory.html
      http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/util.classloader.PluginClassLoader.html
  
  - Fixed memory leaks
    * For unsuccessful logins
    * Removed allocation of SubjectInfo in htpasswd

  - INCOMPATIBLE mime access plugin interface change.
    This is of importance only if you use your own mime based plugins.
    The I_AccessFilter interface method 'match()' changed from
      match(SubjectInfo publisher, SubjectInfo receiver, ...
    to
      match(SessionInfo publisher, SessionInfo receiver, ...

  - INCOMPATIBLE plugin interface change.
    This is of importance only if you use your own plugins.
    The I_Plugin interface method changed from
      public void init(org.xmlBlaster.util.Global glob, String[] options)
    to
      public void init(org.xmlBlaster.util.Global glob, org.xmlBlaster.util.plugin.PluginInfo pluginInfo)
    The package name changed from
     org.xmlBlaster.util.plugin.I_Plugin
    to
     org.xmlBlaster.util.plugin.I_Plugin

  - INCOMPATIBLE property change.
    To load protocol plugins this form is not supported anymore:
      Protocol.Drivers=IOR:org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.CorbaDriver
      Protocol.CallbackDrivers=IOR:org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.CallbackCorbaDriver
    the new syntax is:
      ProtocolPlugin[IOR][1.0]=org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.CorbaDriver
      CbProtocolPlugin[IOR][1.0]=org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.CallbackCorbaDriver
    See xmlBlaster/config/xmlBlaster.properties.template for more examples
    You definitly need to search your code, property files and shell
    scripts and replace to the new syntax.
    
  - Updated to JacORB_1_4_1
    -> NO: moved back to 1.3.30, the new version blocked
    in some cases.

  - Some minor, incompatible changes to the C++ xmlBlaster client lib
    * There is now a CORBA independend util::MsgUnit
    * CorbaConnection.cpp has now CORBA independend method variants
      which are based on STL
    * Fixed memory leaks (in the client C++ libs) 

  - Added administration support for killSession/killClient

  - C++ support for omniORB added (Nils Nilson)

  - C++ support for TAO added (Martin Johnson)
    Added an ant based build.xml file to compile with TAO
    See xmlBlaster/src/c++/tao.xml

  - Bugfix in C++ publishOneway() (reported by Nils Nilson)

  - Bugfix in XmlRpc login method which ignored
    credentials (reported by Oliver Fels)
    login() works now but is deprecated, use connect() instead

  - New PHP demo client, see
      xmlBlaster/demo/php/xmlrpc/README

  - Updated Perl demo client, see
      xmlBlaster/demo/perl/xmlrpc/README

  - Changed to generate key oid without special characters which
    prevents oid to be used as file name, bug reported by
    Doug.Palmer@csiro.au

  - Fixed isVolatile() memory leak reported by liuwen@onewaveinc.com

  - Removed CLASSPATH settings from build.sh/build.bat
    They are now in build.xml

  - Added JacORB1_3_30 bugfix in lib/jacorb.jar
    Patched JacORB1_3_30/lib/org/jacorb/orb/BasicAdapter\$Listener.class:
    Changed to if( address_string.indexOf( "/" ) >= 0 )
    to fix bug when IP has no DNS entry

  - Updated to use newest JUnit 3.8.1

  - Added new documentation (all are CLOSED), see
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/interface.update.html

          now.

  - Bugfix for client side -bootstrapHostname parameter.

  - Automatic detection of the local IP for dial in hosts
    with dynamic IP. In most cases you don't need to
    specify the callback server hostname any more.

  - Added <duplicateUpdates>true/false</duplicateUpdates> to ConnectQos
    This allows for multiple subscribes of one client sessions on
    the same me message to only receive on update.
    Defaults to true.
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.qos.subscribe.duplicate.html

  - Added more administrative introspection properties:
    nodeId, version, buildTimestamp, buildJavaVendor, buildJavaVersion
    numNodes, nodeList etc.

Changes for 0.79f [Jun, 17 2002]
================================

  - Added runlevel listener framework to allow switching between
    run levels like RUNNING, CLEANUP, STANDBY and HALTED

    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/admin.html
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/admin.telnet.html
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/admin.commands.html
 
  - Added full administration access from telnet on properties and
    xmlBlaster core attributes
    This is based on remotecons.jar 1.0
    See http://wttools.sourceforge.net/ and
    http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/admin.telnet.html

  - Changed default security plugin from 'simple' to Cyrilles 'htpasswd'
    http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/authentication/plugins/htpasswd/README
 
    HtPassWd is now extended to accept partial usernames. e.g. if the passwordsfile contains
     "Username", HtPassWd also accepts "User". Additionally if the passwordfile just contains
     "*" any username and password is accepted [Andreas Stelzl]
 
  - Added support for dirty reads in clusters
    http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/cluster.dirtyRead.html

    http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.callback.html

  - Rewritten callback handling

  - PtP bugfix if a client disappears silently

  - Added invocation recorder plugin framework to queue
    messages on client side on failure:
    1. RamRecorder.java
    2. FileRecorder.java
    http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/util.recorder.html

  - Bugfix for similar XPath subscriptions of many clients

  - Bugfix for volatile message deletion with multiple subscribers

  - Sepcific logging, examples:
    -trace[cluster] true   Trace cluster
    -trace[mime] true      Trace mime plugins
    -call[core] true       Show function calls in core
    -dump[corba] true      Dump message sent/received by corba plugin

  - XmlBlasterProperty is deprecated to use directly, use Global instead:
      glob.getProperty().get("myProp", "defaultVal");
    Added Global argument to many classes, but you can access
    the first Global instance with:
      Global glob = Global.instance();

  - Log.java is deprecated to use directly, use Global with LogChannel instead:
      glob.getLog("corba").warn("X", "Y");

  - Testsuite: Ported from Junit 1.0 to Junit 3.7

  - Splitted PropertyQueue class to handle client connect queue
    and server callback queue

  - The generated key oid now contains the node id

  - The default boot strap port is now 3412,
    the IANA assigned xmlblaster port.
    XmlBlaster listens with its tiny internal
    http server on 3412 to deliver the CORBA IOR
    and in future other informations.
    Port 7609 is not used as a default any more.

  - Server internal changes:
    Tuned performance for internal messages

  - Changed subscriptionId to contain a prefix
 
  - Changed (bugfix?) message erase behavior: When a message
    is deleted, the subscribe on it is not destroyed but placed as
    a reservation.

  - Added support to unSubscribe not only with subscribeId but
    with the key-oid as well

  - Added basic cluster support, see
    http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/cluster.html

  - Extended C++ compile support with build.xml and ant,
    runs fine on Linux/gcc, needs to be adapted on Windows

  - Bugfix:
    The persistent http servlet is now fully configurable with web.xml

  - Bugfix:
    The startup options "-logFile x.log -logConsole false" work again

  - Bugfix:
    The internal logged in user "__user..." have now unlimited session
    timeouts.

  - Bugfix:
    In the XmlBlaster GUI the XPath query failed (login is not supported any more)
    since 0.79e, this is fixed now

  - Renamed SubscribeFilter to AccessFilter
    Renamed SubscribePluginManager to AccessPluginManager
    Added filter support to get() QoS

  - Changed C++ client to use as a default the newest
    mico 2.3.7 and xerces 1.7.0
    Removed 'loginName' parameter in update() method

  - A get() which doesn't find a message returns now a MsgUnit[]
    of length 0.
    In older releases there was thrown an XmlBlasterException.

  - Changed behaviour for java client method disconnect()
    disconnect now shutdown the protocol driver and callback server as well.
    See javadoc API of XmlBlasterConnection.

  - Incompatible changes:
    ---------------------
    * publish() returns now XML string instead of the plain oid
      Introduced PublishReturnQos, see
      http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/interface.publish.html

    * Incompatible change of ConnectQos:
      The constructor expects now a Global instance as the
      first argument (you can pass null).

    * Incompatible change of command line options:
      -client.failSave.retryInterval   ->  -delay
      -client.failSave.pingInterval    ->  -pingInterval
      -client.failSave.retries         ->  -retries
      -client.failSave.maxInvocations  ->  -queue/maxEntries
      -client.publishOneway.collectTime->  -burstMode.collectTimeOneway

    * Incompatible change:
      Removed XmlKeyBase.java, use XmlKey.java instead
      XmlKeyBase.DEFAULT_contentMimeExtended -> Constants.DEFAULT_CONTENT_MIME_EXTENDED

    * Incompatible change of file name:
      UpdateQoS.java -> UpdateQos.java

    * Incompatible change of command line options:
      -dispatch/callback/protocol/ior/iorStringHost  ->  -hostname
      -dispatch/callback/protocol/ior/iorStringPort  ->  -port
      -dispatch/callback/protocol/ior/iorStringFile  ->  -dispatch/callback/protocol/ior/iorString.file
 
    * Incompatible change of QoS returns:
      Old: "<qos><state>OK</state></qos>"
      New: "<qos><state id="OK"/></qos>"
   

Changes for 0.79e [Mar, 27 2002]
================================

  - SOCKET protocol driver performance tune:
    Using now read() and write() with large buffer
    See xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/protocol/socket/Parser.java

  - Added client side burst mode for publishOneway
    in java client helper classes.
    See -client.publishOneway.collectTime 500

  - Added dBase JDBC driver 'tinySQL' to allow regression test, see
      http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.service.rdbms.html
      http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.service.rdbms.jdbcpool.html

  - Extended Perl support (from Cyrille)

  - RMI and XmlRpc interface changes.
    see CORBA changes in
    xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/protocol/corba/xmlBlaster.idl

  - CORBA changes in xmlBlaster.idl
    (xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/protocol/corba/xmlBlaster.idl)
    
    The xmlBlaster server:
     Added:
       oneway void publishOneway(in MsgUnitArr msgUnitArr);
       string ping(in string qos);
     Removed:
       boolean ping()
  
    The authentication server:
     Added:
       string ping(in string qos);
  
    The callback server:
     Added:
       oneway void updateOneway(in string sessionId, in serverIdl::MsgUnitArr msgUnitArr);
       string ping(in string qos);
     Changed:
       The update() is changed to receive a cbSessionId and to return a String[]
       It may throw an exception now, since it is not oneway anymore.

  - Java client helper classes:
    The update() method changed incompatible !!
    * The first argument now returns the callback sessionId.
      This is the id you passed on registering your callback server
      and allows you to authenticate the callback invoker.
    * You need to return a QoS string in this version.
      For the time being just return an empty String "" (not null).

  - Changes to Java client library. We now support separate
    instantiation of callback protocol drivers and client drivers.
    See: xmlBlaster/testsuite/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/qos/TestCorbaThreads.java
         for an example.

  - Added a framework to add your own MIME based plugins to filter subscriptions
    Please read
       http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/mime.plugin.subscribe.html
    to find out what this is about (it contains a nice picture)
    and
       http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/mime.plugin.subscribe.howto.html
    how to code your own plugin. 

  - For PtP messages <forceQueuing> is now an
    attribute of <destination forceQueuing='true'>

  - For PtP messages <forceUpdate> defaults now to true

  - Added support for dead letters on failure
    http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.qos.login.session.html

  - Added support for multiple sessions per client.
    A user may now login multiple times with the same login name.
    The different login sessions are timeout controlled, see
    http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.qos.login.session.html

  - Added support for sophisticated queueing, priority messages,
    guaranteed sequence, burst mode (sending messages in a bulk)
    and much more, see:
    http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.queue.html
    http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.callback.html
    http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.message.html

  - PublisQosWrapper, setting boolean values require a parameter now:
    setReadonly()    -> setReadonly(true)
    setForceUpdate() -> setForceUpdate(true)

  - Change get() and subscribe() QoS:
    <noMeta/>    to <meta>false</meta>
    <noContent/> to <content>false</content>
    <noLocal/>   to <local>false</local>
    Constructor of SubscribeQosWrapper() is inverted!

  - Heinrich has made the plugin interface more generic.
    See xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/util/I_Plugin.java

  - Native XML persistence support added.
    Heinrich has added Xindice (a native XML DB) support as persistence
    layer of xmlBlaster.
    See xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/engine/persistence/xmldb/README
      http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.persistence.xmldb.html

  - build.sh and build.bat have new targets:
       build.sh dist          (collect xmlblaster server files)
       build.sh dist-client   (collects java client classes in xmlBlasterClient.jar,
                               with many variants)
       build.sh cpp-lib       (builds a C++ client shared library or dll)
       build.sh cpp-test      (compiles/links C++ CORBA clients)
    Try
       build.sh usage
    to see all possible options.

  - Behavior change [Juergen Freidling]:
    xmlBlaster now respects multiple subscriptions
    on the same message, and will deliver this message multiple times
    to the same client.

  - Bugfixed jutils.jar added:
    * Removed JDBC pool code (does not compile with JDK 1.4)
    * Bugfix for xmlBlaster.properties file in CLASSPATH

  - Added complete demo code how to access xmlBlaster
    from C using XmlRpc
         Read xmlBlaster/demo/c/xmlrpc/README

  - Added OS independend C++ compile support with ant
    TODO: Adapt to run on Windows as well.

  - Reduced necessary environment settings to
      JAVA_HOME=<pathToJdk>
      CLASSPATH=<xmlBlaster>/lib/xmlBlaster.jar


Changes for 0.79d [Dec, 30 2001]
================================

  - CORBA/C++ client helper classes now support http IOR download, e.g.:
       TestGet -dispatch/callback/protocol/ior/iorStringHost myHost -dispatch/callback/protocol/ior/iorStringPort 7609

  - Changed/Enhanced property file lookup for C++ clients
    see xmlBlaster/src/c++/util/Property.h

  - Changed to support security QoS tags for login() method
    Performance changes to avoid double qos parsing of connect QoS
    (bug reported by Cyrille, again keeping me busy :-)

  - Added SVG sample code for persistent http callback, see

      demo/http/svg/systemInfo

  - Ported persistent http callback framework to tomcat 3.2.4, use

      build.sh deploy_war

  - Added C++ support in build.xml, to compile the
    xmlBlaster C++ client helper shared library (so, sl, dll) type:

       build.sh cpp-lib

  - Changed C++ file extension .cc to .cpp
    Holger Lehn ported C++ clients to Windows using stlport library

  - Added a message receive timestamp in update QoS, see:
    http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.qos.update.rcvTimestamp.html
    The feature is not yet used by the server.

  - Bugfix when interpreting command line option -xmlrpc.hostname

  - The C++ client helper classes are now collected into a
    shared library, on Linux e.g.
       xmlBlaster/lib/libxmlBlasterClient.so
    The new C++ namespace is
       org::xmlBlaster

  - Added an email callback plugin (protocol="EMAIL").
    This allows callbacks to be send using email instead e.g. CORBA
    See xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/email/README

  - New 'passwd' style Security Plugin from Cyrille Giquello, see

      xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster> cd authentication/plugins/htpasswd/README

  - Added Update QoS element <queue> with queue informations
    (Thanks to Cyrille)

  - UpdateQos and UpdateKey: Renamed printOn() to toXml()

  - Added default corbaloc to xmlBlaster server and naming service
    This allows connecting to a local naming service without configuration

  - Corrected shell scripts in xmlBlaster/bin directory
    to reflect the new JacORB package names

  - Added a LDAP security plugin, please follow
    instrutions in 

      xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/authentication/plugins/ldap/README
      
    to test it. It is quite simple.
     

Changes for 0.79c [Sep, 05 2001]
================================

 - Remove your old xmlBlaster.properties, jacorb.properties
   and orb.properties files.
   Use the new files from directory xmlBlaster/config
   if wanted.

 - Backward compatibility:
   * Clients accessing xmlBlaster directly (C++,Python,Perl)
     will run with old xmlBlaster servers.
   * Clients using the Java helper classes will only connect
     to the new xmlBlaster 0.79c, since these classes
     use the new security plugin.

 - Changed <noPtP/> to <ptp>false</ptp>

 - Ported to JacORB 1.3.30
   NOTE: You need to copy the new
      config/jacorb.properties.template
     to
      $HOME/jacorb.properties
     If you use orb.properties, please install the new
      config/orb.properties

 - Extended Java client helper class XmlBlasterConnection
   to allow dispatching callback messages.
   Every subcription may specify its dedicated callback handle.
   See xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/ClientSubDispatch.java as
   an example.

 - Added Authentication and Authorization framework by Wolfgang Kleinertz

   xmlBlaster.idl has changed, new methods connect() and disconnect()
   as counterpart to login() and logout()

   Please copy the modified config/xmlBlaster.properties.template
   to $HOME/xmlBlaster.properties

   In xmlBlaster.properties uncomment the line
      Security.Client.DefaultPlugin=gui,1.0
   and start for example "java javaclients.ClientSub" to see xmlBlaster
   with GUI based manual authentication/authorization.

   To study raw CORBA access with the new security plugin see
      xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/corba/ClientRawSecurity.java

 - Changed XMLRPC 'void' method return values to return
   an 'empty string', since 'void' is not supported in the
   XMLRPC spec.
   Bug reported by Cyrille Giquello <cyrille@ktaland.com>

 - Added qos support for get() responses, for example:
   <qos>
     <state>
       OK
     </state>
     <sender>
       Tim
     </sender>
   </qos>

 - Fixed C++ testclients in xmlBlaster/testsuite/src/c++

 - It is now possible to query the current logged in users
   by "__sys__UserList"
   Feature added by "Gilles Lavaux" <gilles.lavaux@esrin.esa.it>

 - KNOWN BUGS:
   * The "simple" security plugin is needed for the JDBC driver to login.
     This will be changed in a future release.

Changes for 0.79b [March, 11 2001]
==================================

 - Bugfix with Base64 support in xmlrpc (thanks to Nikolai Devereaux)

 - J2EE support added by Peter Antman
   See: xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/j2ee/k2/README
   See: xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/j2ee/k2
   New jars for J2EE support:
   connector.jar jaas.jar jta-spec1_0_1.jar
   jms.jar ejb2.0.jar jndi-jdk1_3_1.jar
   (The jndi jar is needed for JDK 1.2 only)

 - Added support for volatile messages (thanks to Peter Antman).
   A volatile messages exists only during publish and processing it (doing the updates).
   A non-volatile messages (which is default) stays in memory as long as the server runs.

 - erase() now reports the correct number of erased messages
   if some of the messages did not exist.

 - Change of behaviour (thanks to Stefan Nickisch):
   If a callback to a client fails, the subscription will be
   automatically canceled for this client.

 - Integrated JacORB CORBA release 1.3.11
   Please copy the new xmlBlaster/config/jacorb.properties.template
   to $HOME/jacorb.properties (replacing the old one).

 - Added _release() calls to avoid JacORB memory leak on shutdown()

 - Bug fixed in JDBC adapter, NullPointerException because of
   missing namespace (thanks to Juergen Freidling).

 - Subscribe Bug fixed (reported by Stefan Nickisch)
   If a subscriber crashes without logout, this will disturb all other
   subscribers.
   No more communication is possible until the crashed subscriber will log on
   again.

 - Added proper RMI server and callback server shutdown

 - Renamed servlet-2.0.jar to servlet.jar

 - Added a simple Python hello world demo,
   see xmlBlaster/demo/python/README

 - Messages from the persistent store now deliver the correct
   sender name, the unique login name of the publisher.
   Thanks to Suhas Bharambe for reporting the bug.

 - Persistent Db integration (code, but no release).

 - Changed to JAXP and DOM2 Sun/crimson XML parser
   jaxp-1.1ea2 from SUN, DOM2 SAX2

 - Changed code to conform to SAX2

 - Login QoS has no <noPtP> element anymore, this is set
   for each CallbackAddress from now on, e.g.:
     <callback type='IOR'>
        http:/www.mars.universe:8080/RPC2
        <PtP>false</PtP> <!-- Set this flag if you don't want to receive any PtP messages -->
                         <!-- prevents 'spamming' -->
     </callback>


Changes for 0.79a [Nov, 16 2000]
================================

 - xmlBlaster license change to 'pure' LGPL

 - JacORB as CORBA default:
   Setting default System properties to
     org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass=org.jacorb.orb.ORB
     org.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass=org.jacorb.orb.ORBSingleton
   in our CORBA drivers (if not set differently from environment).

 - Severe bugfix with CORBA POA sessionId.
   This bug caused sometimes the POA sessionId to be not unique,
   causing a subsecquent login to auto logout another client.

 - FileDriver is switched on as default (persistent store).
   You need to replace your xmlBlaster.properties
   with the new xmlBlaster.properties.template or set
   Persistence.LazyRecovery=true

 - Several smaller fixes.


Changes for 0.79 [Nov, 3 2000]
==============================
  - Bugfix for CORBA client/server running on multi homed hosts:
       java -DOAIAddr=198.197.24.129 javaclients.chat.SimpleChat
    for example forces the chat corba-callback server to use
    the given ip address.
       java -DOAIAddr=198.197.24.129 org.xmlBlaster.Main
    forces xmlBlaster to use the given address.
    xmlBlaster/lib/jacorb.jar is patched (see lib/README).

  - NOTE: CorbaConnection.java removed, please use
    XmlBlasterAccess.java instead.
    This allows to switch the used protocol (IOR,RMI,XMLRPC)
    on command line without recompilation.
    For coding example see demo/javaclients/ClientSub.java
    To switch protocol use the -dispatch/connection/protocol command line option.
    Example:
      jaco javaclients.ClientSub -dispatch/connection/protocol IOR
      jaco javaclients.ClientSub -dispatch/connection/protocol RMI
      jaco javaclients.ClientSub -dispatch/connection/protocol XMLRPC

  - NOTE: You need to use the new xmlBlaster.properties file.
    Remove your old in your HOME directory and use the
    new template from xmlBlaster/config as a base.

  - NOTE: JDK_HOME is not used anymore, use JAVA_HOME instead.

  - NOTE: You need to replace
       import org.xmlBlaster.client.CorbaConnection;
    with
       import org.xmlBlaster.client.protocol.XmlBlasterConnection;
    if you have used this class in your java clients.
    Then replace all occurrences of
       CorbaConnection
    with
       XmlBlasterConnection
    The login() method has changed to return void.

  - The built in http IOR download server is now more close
    to HTTP 1.1 spec RFC 2068

  - New command line argument added to xmlBlaster server:
    -dispatch/callback/protocol/ior/iorStringHost <host>
    allows to specify where the internal http server publishes
    its bootstrapping IOR (for multi homed hosts).

  - build.xml:  Target 'all' collects demo and testuite classes
    into xmlBlaster.jar as well.

  - NEW: Easy installation: Ready to go in 30 seconds!
    Added customized MANIFEST to xmlBlaster.jar, allowing
    to start xmlBlaster without any CLASSPATH setting:
       java -jar lib/xmlBlaster.jar
    See INSTALL file.

  - RMI driver looks for xmlBlaster.polcy now in CLASSPATH as well, e.g.
       export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$XMLBLASTER_HOME/config
    whith $XMLBLASTER_HOME/config/xmlBlaster.policy

  - Migrated to XMLRPC java.1.0_beta_4

  - Migrated to Ant 1.2

  - Migrated to JacORB 1.2.2

  - Changed package for FileDriver, modify xmlBlaster.properties to
      Persistence.Driver=org.xmlBlaster.engine.persistence.filestore.FileDriver

  - Changed logging to use jutils Log classes
    NOTE: you need to change in your code:
       import org.jutils.log.Log;
    to
       import org.xmlBlaster.util.Log;

  - Michele completed xml-rpc support

  - Moved xmlBlaster.properties.template to config directory

  - Moved jacorb.properties.template to config directory

  - Moved orb.properties to config directory

Changes for 0.78 [Jul, 14 2000]
==============================
  - Added generic database access from James to xmlBlaster core.
    The JDBC gateway uses now the native interface to xmlBlaster.
    Added advanced JDBC connection pooling. Every user has
    its own pool, allowing heavy load server simultaneous
    database access (thread save).
    See online requirements for more informations/examples:
       http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.service.rdbms.html
       http://www.xmlBlaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.service.rdbms.jdbcpool.html

  - Michele Laghi added complete C++ client support for MICO and ORBacus.
    He implemented all necessary C++ client helper classes for easy and cool
    xmlBlaster access.

  - Moved xmlBlaster/src/idl/xmlBlaster.idl to directory
    xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/protocol/corba/xmlBlaster.idl

  - Changed package names:
    org.xmlBlaster.engine.persistence.I_PersistenceDriver -> org.xmlBlaster.engine.I_PersistenceDriver
    org.xmlBlaster.engine.persistence.FileDriver          -> org.xmlBlaster.engine.FileDriver
    org.xmlBlaster.util.MsgUnit                       -> org.xmlBlaster.util.MsgUnit
    org.xmlBlaster.util.Destination                       -> org.xmlBlaster.util.qos.address.Destination
    org.xmlBlaster.util.CallbackAddress                   -> org.xmlBlaster.util.qos.address.CallbackAddress
    NOTE: You need to replace your xmlBlaster.properties
    with the new xmlBlaster.properties.template!

  - Changed classes:
    MsgUnit now contains the qos
    MsgUnitContainer is removed.
    Note that there is a CORBA MsgUnit and a engine.helper.MsgUnit
    class (same name, same members).

  - xmlBlaster.properties allows variables ${...} replacement.
    see util.property.args.xml, util.property.env.xml, util.property.xml
    NOTE: You need to replace your xmlBlaster.properties
    with the new xmlBlaster.properties.template!

  - The "+" for command line options (e.g. +trace) is not supported
    any more, use for example '-trace true' instead.

  - There is now RMI support for xmlBlaster available.
    The Servers are in
       xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/protocol/rmi
    A simple demo client is in
       xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/rmi
    Read the INSTALL file about how to use RMI support.
    This is an alpha release, no test suite etc. yet.
    The reason for RMI support is a future support
    of JINI (which is based on RMI).
    The Discovery and Lookup of Jini are very fault tolerant
    and could be a base for xmlBlaster replication,
    load balancing and master/slave operation.

  - Added XmlBlasterException.java in org.xmlBlaster.util package.
    This allows Corba independend Exception handling.
    The xmlBlaster.idl defined XmlBlasterException
    is not removed and still resides in package
       org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.serverIdl
    NOTE: You need to change the package of XmlBlasterException
    in your code as well (if not thrown from Corba).

  - Added new package org.jutils to the xmlBlaster distribution.
    This replaces org.xmlBlaster.util over the time.
    You need to set the environment variable JUTILS_HOME to:
      export JUTILS_HOME=${XMLBLASTER_HOME}
    Changed package names:
       org.xmlBlaster.util.Log          -> org.jutils.log.Log
       org.xmlBlaster.util.FileUtil     -> org.jutils.io.FileUtil
       org.xmlBlaster.util.Queue        -> org.jutils.collection.Queue
       org.xmlBlaster.util.Args         -> org.jutils.init.Args
       org.xmlBlaster.util.Property     -> org.jutils.init.Property
       org.xmlBlaster.util.Memory       -> org.jutils.runtime.Memory
       org.xmlBlaster.util.StringHelper -> org.jutils.text.StringHelper
       org.xmlBlaster.util.StopWatch    -> org.jutils.time.StopWatch
       org.xmlBlaster.util.Timeout      -> org.jutils.time.Timeout
    rm Args.java FileUtil.java LogListener.java Log.java Memory.java Property.java Queue.java StopWatch.java StringHelper.java

  - Compiled successfully xmlBlaster with JDK 1.3 for Linux.
    Performance enhancment for CORBA access ~ 80%

  - Compiled successfully xmlBlaster with TowerJ native compiler.
    Performance enhancment for CORBA access ~ 30%
    See .bashrc for used settings

  - Added protocol plugin possibility in xmlBlaster.properties
    Default settings are Corba drivers, example for RMI is provided as well:
      #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      # List of all xmlBlaster access protocol drivers (I_Driver and I_Callback implementations)
      # <protocol-type>:<driverClass>,<protocl-type>:<driverClass>,...
      # For protocol types see I_Driver.java
      Protocol.Drivers=IOR:org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.CorbaDriver
      Protocol.CallbackDrivers=IOR:org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.CallbackCorbaDriver

  - Added native interface for xmlBlaster: I_XmlBlaster.
    All plugged in protocol drivers need to use this interface.
    The authentication is checked there in a controlled way.

  - The package org.xmlBlaster.authenticate is now CORBA independend.
    It uses or generates a unique sessionId string to track a login session
    of a user. This allows easier integration of other
    protocols like xml-rpc.

  - Bug fix in PoolManager.erase() method

  - ClientConnection: removed deprecated logout(server)
                      Added killPing() in logout()

Changes for 0.77 [Jun, 3 2000]
===============================
  - Bugfix in Main - MainGUI swapping and log WARN toggle.

  - browser callback enhancement:
    It is now possible to pass the login name and the password
    through the session object of the servlet (cookie).
    This allows you to use your own authentication.
    See client.browser.xml requirement how to do it.

  - Bugfix for XPath subscription match errors.
    Thanks to "Brett Palmer" <plum001@hotmail.com>
    for finding and describing this bug.

  - Stripped from jacorb.jar unneeded classes.
    This reduces the size from 3.7 MB to 2.3 MB.

  - Bug work around for thread leak: The thread leak from
    JacORB 1.1 is for the bug being fixed in CorbaConnection.java

  - Bugfix in CorbaConnection.java: Cleanup for Callback server added.

  - Changed XML parser to jaxp 1.0.1 and added servlet support
    to xtdash.jar (from original xt.jar).
    NOTE: You need to remove xml.jar from your CLASSPATH and
    add jaxp.jar and parser.jar (see xmlBlaster/lib directory)

  - Changed xmlBlaster.idl
    from
       login(in string loginName, in string passwd,
                  in clientIdl::BlasterCallback cb,
                  in serverIdl::XmlType qos)
    to
       login(in string loginName, in string passwd,
                  in serverIdl::XmlType qos)
    The callback protocol and address is now passed using
    the xml based qos.
    NOTE: You need to change your client code as well!
    See requirement engine.qos.login.callback

  - CORBA implementors other than JACORB and MICO can now be used. ORBACUS
    can work for the xmlBlaster server, java clients and c++ clients. You
    need OB-4.0b3 (for c++) and JOB-4.0b3 (for Java) or higher. You can
    find more about ORBACUS at http://www.ooc.com.

  - Persistent browser callback bugfixes
    * Added proper logout
    * Fixed security hole
    * Added support to set system properties through initArgs
    * Removed memory leak
    * Added ping/pong, to allow servlet to detect a lost browser


Changes for 0.76 [May.8, 2000]
===============================
        - Added a client cache to CorbaConnection class, allowing
          clients cheap synchronous polling for a message (Java only).
          See xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.cache.xml

        - Added demo for http browser callback without closing the http
          connection.
          See
            xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.browser.xml
            xmlBlaster/demo/html/systemInfo
            xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/protocol/http
          and online:
            http://www.xmlBlaster.org/systemInfo/systemInfo.html?ActionType=login&loginName=karl&passwd=secret

          Netscape 4.x on Linux/HPUX/Win and
          Netscape 4.7 / MSIE 5 on WinNT and Win98
          runs fine.

        - Bugfixes (especially memory leak fixed) in browser
          callback framework.

        - Logging output can now be customized.
          You can choose the Date and Time formatting and the
          language and country.
          The amount of logging information is adjustable as well.
          Example:
        "Saturday, April 29, 2000 7:05:49 PM GMT+02:00 INFO Published AuthServer IOR on port 7609"
          or    in french:
        "samedi 29 avril 2000 19 h 06 GMT+02:00 INFO Published AuthServer IOR on port 7609"
          or    in short form german:
        "29.04.00 19:07 INFO Published AuthServer IOR on port 7609"
          or    minimal:
        "Published AuthServer IOR on port 7609"
          See xmlBlaster.properties.template    how to use it.

        - Bugfix when logging to file with missing permissions in Util.java
          The bug resulted in a never ending    loop.

        - xmlBlaster.properties can now be placed in    'java.home' directory
          as    well (this is for example /opt/jdk1.2.2/jre/lib).
          This feature may be helpful if you    want to start a deamon
          or    a servlet which has no home directory.
          See org.xmlBlaster.util.Property for more informations

        - xmlBlaster now uses the new JacORB 1.1 with SSL support

        - .jacorb_properties is renamed to jacorb.properties
          YOU NEED TO REMOVE YOUR $HOME/.jacorb_properties and
          configure $HOME/jacorb.properties
          Use the xmlBlaster/jacorb.properties.template as a base

        - Peter added the sweet rainbow fish to our control panel

        - Enhancements with browser callback framework

        - XmlKey.getContentMimeExtended() now returns "" (empty string)
          as    default fallback. Before the default was null.
          This is smarter when used in XSL style sheets.

Changes for 0.75 [Mar.28, 2000]
===============================

        - Konrad completed the fabulous Browser callback framework!
          And it works incredible well.
          Browsers get instant callback updates from xmlBlaster messages
          through a persistent http connection.
          It supports many feature like browser pinging, slow
          browser queuing etc.
          Konrad will write a little tutorial in the next week.
          See xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/protocol/http
          See xmlBlaster/doc/http/BlasterHttpProxy.gif

        - Added little tool which allows to subscribe
          from command line for a message (for testing/debugging).
          See xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/client/reader/README

        - Added two internal messages with key oid="__sys__Login"
          and key oid="__sys__Logout"
          You may subscribe on those messages if you want to be informed
          about other client which login or logout

        - Added a xmlBlaster reference handbook to xmlBlaster.org
          This page is generated from the requirement XML files in the
          xmlBlaster/doc/requirements directory of the distribution.
          It is available on our homepage in the 'Doc' section.

        - Bugfix if the Callback of a PtP receiver is disappeared,
          this usually happens when the receiver crashes without a logout.
          Now the XmlBlasterException with e.id="CallbackFailed" is thrown
          to the sender,  and the message is queued for the receiver
          if the qos flag <ForceQueuing> was set.

        - Allow clients to ping xmlBlaster, to test reliable the connection.
          The xmlBlaster.idl was extended with a ping() method.
          Java clients may use CorbaConnection.java to automatically test
          ping the connection.

        - Added <qos> tag <subscriptionId> for update messages.
          This allows the client to find out which of his subscriptions
          caused this update.

        - Added <qos> tag <state> for update messages.
          This is not finished, it always shows OK for the moment.

        - Command line parameters (args) and xmlBlaster.property file entries are
          merged. The 'args' overwrite the property file variables.
          Every xmlBlaster.property variable may as well be specified on
          command line. The leading "-" or "+" from the command line    key is
          stripped before it    is merged into the properties hash table.
          For example, the "-dispatch/callback/protocol/ior/iorString.file" command line argument corresponds to the
          "ior.file" variable    in the xmlBlaster.properties file.
          See Property.java


Changes for 0.74 [Feb.29, 2000]
==============================
        - New XML based requirements framework.
          See xmlBlaster/doc/requirements

        - 'Fail save' client connection for Java clients added.
          Clients begin polling and automatic local recording of messages
          if xmlBlaster server disappears.
          See CorbaConnection.java

        - C++ POA demo client added [Michele]
          See xmlBlaster/testsuite/src/c++

        - Recorder to record/playback of messages in slow/fast motion added.
          See InvocationRecorder.java

        - CorbaConnection: logout(boolean) deprecated -> use logout() now.

        - Changed xmlBlaster.idl: messageUnit    -> msgUnit
                                  messageUnitArr -> msgUnitArr
          Case does not matter, IDL is case-insensitive when detecting name clashes.
          (Thanks to Michele Laghi)

        - Added a guide line for xmlBLaster core developer.
          See xmlBlaster/doc/developer-guidelines.html

        - Set up xmlBLaster to use Ant as it's build system [James]

        - Added the revolutionary XML based JDBC database gateway. [James]
          see xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/protocol/jdbc
          see xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/jdbc

        - Added servlet - browser callback framework (not yet finished)
          see xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/protocol/http


Changes for 0.73 [Feb.20, 2000]
==============================
        - Use the -P    option to check out, so old directories won't show up any more:
          cvs checkout -P xmlBlaster

        - Migrated to JacORB 1.0 beta 15

        - Reorganized package structure
          org.xmlBlaster.authenticateIdl  ->    org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.authenticateIdl
          org.xmlBlaster.serverIdl        -> org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.serverIdl
          org.xmlBlaster.clientIdl        -> org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.clientIdl
          org.xmlBlaster.client.filestore ->    org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.client.feeder
          org.xmlBlaster.engine.xml2java  ->    new added

        - Improved client / server connection negotiation (IOR bootstrapping)

        - Introduced DocBook schema
          Documentation is written in xml, and converted
          to html/pdf etc. with XSL style sheets.
          See example in xmlBlaster/doc/whitepaper/README

        - Further minor changes (see cvs log or cvsweb if you really want to know it)


Changes for 0.72 [Feb.1, 2000]
==============================

        - Support for new QoS tag <ForceQueuing /> in PtP style.
          * Without this flag, a message published to a client which is not
                 logged in throws an exception.
          * Using this flag, the message will be queued by xmlBlaster
                 until the client logs in. On login, all queued messages
                 are sent to the client immediately.

        - Added some simple console input mode, to control xmlBlaster
          Type <?> and <Enter> when xmlBlaster is running to get help.

        - Extended control panel GUI to support
          * dumping of xmlBlaster internal state
          * clearing the logging window
          * toggle from control panel GUI to console mode and back again

        - Bug fixed for subscribe with oid and later publish of this message.
          The BigXmlDom was not updated properly.

        - Added support for <qos><Readonly /></qos>,
          where only the first publish is accepted.

        - Added logging redirection to file,
          use on command line "-?" to query possible parameters.

        - Bug fixed for multiple login (without logout) and PtP messages.

        - Bug fixed for multiple <persistent/> messages.

        - Added missing FileDriver.erase().

        - Two bug fixes with unSubscribe() calls for previous XPATH subscriptions.


Changes for 0.71 [Jan.20 2000]
==============================

        - Added the incredible MOM slide show, see http://www.xmlBlaster.org

        - Added SubscribeKey.java SubscribeQosWrapper.java as client helper
          to help to hide raw XML ASCII strings

        - Added simple persistent store (file based)
          Needs to be configured in $HOME/xmlBlaster.properties

        - Added a xmlBlaster.properties file (should be placed into $HOME).
          see xmlBlaster/xmlBlaster.properties.template as a base to start with

        - Renamed file names from ...QoS... to ...Qos...

        - Added a file feeder PublishFile.java (publishes files as message to xmlBlaster)

        - Added some help to xmlBlaster/doc/programming-guide.lyx (still ugly)

        - Added usage text, invoke at command line with -? option

        - Small changes here and there
