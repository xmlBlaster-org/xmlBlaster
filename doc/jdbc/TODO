- Check of CLOB are slow

- Add 'limit'

- Increase connectionPoolSize=5

- XB_ENTRIES lookup in Oracle: check other schames as well

- select * from xbstore; xbnode contains "node" ???

- Make StorageId.splitPostfix xbtype specific

- clientpubisher   | connection   | 2
  How to distinguish one client connecting to two different clusters with same login name
  -> Possibility to force the xbnode

- Leak analysis on database
  select xbmeatid from xbmeat, xbref where xbref.xbmeatid = xbmeat.xbmeatid and xbmeat.xbdurable='F';

  Check if ref lost meat ('F' is one to one)
  select * from xbref left outer join xbmeat on (xbref.xbmeatid=xbmeat.xbmeatid) where xbref.xbonetomany='F';

-  We need a delegate to recover exceptions: XbDatabaseAccessorDelegat

- Consistency check is only for old xb_entries: RequestBroker.checkCallbackEntriesConsistency()
