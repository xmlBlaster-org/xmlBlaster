   <topic>XmlBlaster provides a simple file based persistence layer to store messages marked with &lt;persistent/></topic>

      <p>
      To store messages and to restore them again after a new
      startup of the xmlBlaster server there is a lightweight interface,
      called I_PersitenceDriver, available. As a reference implementation
      We provide a very simple file based store, called FileDriver,
      which may be used as a reference implementation to your own persistency.
      Please remind, that the FileDriver implementation is only a simple
      demo, it is based on your filesystem. So don't try to store more then
      some thousands messages with this layer!
      </p>

      If you really want to use this driver for more than some hundred different messages
      we recommend to use it with the ReiserFS.

      Reiserfs is a file system using a plug-in based object oriented variant on classical balanced tree algorithms.
      See the <a href="http://www.reiserfs.org/">ReiserFS homepage</a>
      Only messages which are marked as &lt;persistent/&gt; are stored using this persistent
      layer.
