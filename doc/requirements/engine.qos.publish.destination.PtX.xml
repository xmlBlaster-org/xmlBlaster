   <topic>PtX (Point to XPath) messages are routed using the qos-destination tag</topic>
   <description>
      <p>
      If you specify a  &lt;destination queryType='XPATH'&gt;  tag, the message will be delivered to
      all clients, for which the XPATH query matches.
      Assuming that clients are stored in a dedicated authentication xmlBlaster server,
      every client can be described with meta information in the XmlKey.
      The XPATH queries the client meta info, and all matching clients will receive the message.
      This allows a smart addressing of client with specific roles or in specific groups.
      You may categorize some client with the &lt;MANAGER&gt; tag, and some with the "TRUSTED"
      attribute. This allows to send a message for example to all managers which are trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
      The clients connection name should be in that kind, so I think the term 'key' is misleading here.
      </p>
      <p>
      This is a requirement, we've been talking about before X-mas 2002. It allows to group
      clients with additional terms.
      For example Agents as publisher or Clients as subscriber.
      </p>
      <p>
      The next step would be that those META-Tags have to be in the <code>__sys__Login</code> and
      <code>__sys__Logout</code> messages as well to monitor connections and disconnections of
      this particular client. Probably in the <code>__sys__UserList</code> message as well.
