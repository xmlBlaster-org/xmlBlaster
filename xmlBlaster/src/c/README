  C based SOCKET access to xmlBlaster, May 2003
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a first, tiny quick hack of a C based SOCKET client.
It should compile on Linux, Windows (PocketPC, WinCE) and other UNIX OS.

Features:

  o Support on many OS and easy portable

  o Object size only ~20 KBytes
  
  o Supports synchronous xmlBlaster access with
    connect(), disconnect(), get(), publish(), erase(), ping()
  
  o Asynchronous access with client callback update() is under
    development
    Posix threads DLL for Win, PocketPC, WinCE:
       http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32

  o Reports exception nicely back to the client

  o The client side xmlBlasterAccess structure has function pointers
    for all methods to have object oriented like access,
    see client.c as a usage example


COMPILE:
========

cd xmlBlaster/demo/c/socket   (see client.c)

Linux:    gcc -Wall -g -Isocket -I. -o client *.c socket/*.c -lpthread

Windows:  cl /MT /W3 /Wp64 -D_WINDOWS client.c msgUtil.c socket\*.c ws2_32.lib


Now start xmlBlaster:
=====================

   java org.xmlBlaster.Main -dump[socket] true -trace[socket] true -call[socket] true  -call[core] true

and the C client:

   client

The client connects and does some invocations (see the main() in client.c).


Next steps:
===========

o Clean up the code
 - make a lib from it
 - add callback support
   with pthreads on UNIX and
   http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32 on Windows

o Make layers of functionality
 - raw communication
 - adding threading support to allow callbacks in the same process.
 - expat parsing

o Add some demo in xmlBlaster/demo/c

o Wrap it as a C++ protocol plugin to be independend of CORBA and
 use the C++ testsuite for this C implementation
