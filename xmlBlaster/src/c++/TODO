The C++ client library is fairly complete
and memory leak checked with valgrind.

Following issues however remain:

o Implement QuerySpec tag in QueryQos

o Implement burstMode/maxEntries and burstMode/maxBytes methods in
  ConnectQos -> AddressBase

o implementing the setters and getters for subject queue properties in ConnectQos
  (remember not to pass anything if not explicitly set, otherwise the server will
  reconfigure on each session)

o Add expat xml parser into the distribution
  and use the Arabica SAX2 layer for simple parsing
  -> This avoids to download Xerces separately

o Change ConnectQos to use ClientProperty as well
  (similar to MsgQosData.h)
  This has currently no operational impact

o Check return values 'vector<MsgUnit>' which
  are copies. We could change this to a reference
  argument to improve performance.

o Extend testsuite to check ALL parameters shown with
  PublishDemo -help
  SubscribeDemo -help

o Add valgrind memory leak tests for exception cases

o TestQueue: this test shows memory leaks with valgrind,
  we need to investigate further

o Add subscribe specific 'update()' similar to the Java
  client library approach
