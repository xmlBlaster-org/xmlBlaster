The C++ client library is fairly complete
and memory leak checked with valgrind.

Following issues however remain:

o Add a logging abstraction and add a default library like:
  http://www.codeproject.com/cpp/logdriver.asp
  http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net/
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/logengine/  (GPL)
  http://log4c.sourceforge.net/ (C, no Windows yet)
  http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net/

o Add expat xml parser into the distribution
  and use the Arabica SAX2 layer for simple parsing
  -> This avoids to download Xerces separately

o Change ConnectQos to use ClientProperty as well
  (similar to MsgQosData.h)
  This has currently no operational impact

o Check return values 'vector<MsgUnit>' which
  are copies. We could change this to a reference
  argument to improove performance.

o Extend testsuite to check ALL parameters shown with
  PublishDemo -help
  SubscribeDemo -help

o Add valgrind memory leak tests for exception cases

o TestQueue: this test shows memory leaks with valgrind,
  we need to investigate further

o The client side queue is RAM based only.
  We could embed http://www.sqlite.org/ for persistence

o Add subscribe specific 'update()' similar to the Java
  client library approach
