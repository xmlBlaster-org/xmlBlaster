This plugin communicates with the SOCKET protocol to xmlBlaster.
It uses the C SOCKET client library and wraps it for our C++ code.

COMPILE:

Add
  
  COMPILE_SOCKET_PLUGIN=1

to build.properties and do

  build.sh cpp

Setting COMPILE_SOCKET_PLUGIN=0 will not include any SOCKET
specific code.
(To switch on/off the CORBA plugin compilation use COMPILE_CORBA_PLUGIN=1 or 0)
