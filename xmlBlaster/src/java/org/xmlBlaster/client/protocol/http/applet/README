THIS CODE IS NOT FINISHED, IT IS NOT FUNCTIONAL YET!

This simple client code shall allow applets to connect
to xmlBlaster and receive instant callback messages
with a persistent http connection.

The applet XmlBlasterApplet.java is a demo applet showing
how to do it.

Compile:

  build.sh all

Deploy to tomcat:

  build.sh deploy_war

Start the applet in a browser:

  http://localhost:8080/xmlBlaster/BasicApplet.html


A similar approach we have implemented for a browser without an applet:
