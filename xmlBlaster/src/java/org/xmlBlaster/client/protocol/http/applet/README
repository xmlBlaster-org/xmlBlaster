This simple client code shall allow applets to connect
to xmlBlaster and receive instant callback messages
with a persistent http connection.

Examples how to use it you find in directory
  xmlBlaster/demo/http/applet

The servlet we talk to is under
  xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/protocol/http/appletproxy

Compile:

  build.sh all

Deploy to tomcat:

  build.sh deploy_war

Start the applet in a browser:

  http://localhost:8080/xmlBlaster/HelloWorld3.html


A similar approach we have implemented for a browser without an applet,
using similar servlets:
See: http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.browser.html
     http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/demo/http/index.html

Features:
=========

  o The applet code is very small, all key and QoS are transported in java.util.Map,
    see for example xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/util/qos/MsgQosData.java: toJXPath()
  
  o The Map is transported serialized

  o No XML parser is needed, no xmlBlaster helper classes are needed (only MethodName.java)

Todo:
=====

  o Reconnect if e.g. a proxy closes the connection

  o More tests

Hint:
=====

 To reload the applet classes in your browser during development:
 On Windows, do a "super-reload" by holding down CTRL-SHIFT and refreshing the page.
 On other platforms you must open the Java console (see Applications->Utilities->Java
 on OS X for console settings) and type "x" to empty the JAR file cache.
