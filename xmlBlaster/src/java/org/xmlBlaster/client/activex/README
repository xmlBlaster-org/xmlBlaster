Access bean for Windows ActiveX components, 2004-03-09

This is a first step, the code is not functional yet!

With this control you can access xmlBlaster from C#
or VisualBasic which calls a client side java bean
which again connects to the xmlBlaster server.
All invocations are done with Micheles xml scripting
client, see

  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.script.html
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/beans/axbridge/developerguide/index.html

PRECOND:

 It seems to work only with the ActiveX bridge from JDK 1.5 or higher.
 JDK 1.4 failed on my Windows XP.

INSTALL:

 First you need to create a dll and register it:

   build -DJRE_HOME=C:\PROGRA~1\Java\j2re1.5.0 -DJVM.target=1.4 activex

 Now you find all generated files under

   C:\PROGRA~1\Java\j2re1.5.0\activex

 and the control is registered

   regedit -> HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
           -> CLSID
           -> D824B185-AE3C-11D6-ABF5-00B0D07B8581
           -> XmlScriptAccess Bean Control

DEMO:

  A C# demo client is under xmlBlaster\demo\activex 


TODO:

- Finish the work

- Change Class-Path in manifest.activex
  and add the jar files

- Implement callback events
