Access bean for Windows ActiveX components, 2004-03-09

This is a first step, the code is not functional yet!

With this control you can access xmlBlaster from C#
or VisualBasic which calls a client side java bean
which again connects to the xmlBlaster server.
All invocations are done with Micheles xml scripting
client, see

  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.script.html
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/beans/axbridge/developerguide/index.html

PRECOND:

 It seems to work only with the ActiveX bridge from JDK 1.5 or higher.
 JDK 1.4 failed on my Windows XP.
 Java objects are accessible via wrapper objects supporting the IDispatch interface.

INSTALL:

 First you need to create a dll and register it:

   build -DJRE_HOME=C:\PROGRA~1\Java\j2re1.5.0 -DJVM.target=1.4 activex

 Now you find all generated files under

   C:\PROGRA~1\Java\j2re1.5.0\activex

 and the control is registered

   regedit -> HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
           -> CLSID
           -> D824B185-AE3C-11D6-ABF5-00B0D07B8581
           -> XmlScriptAccess Bean Control

DEMO:

  A functional C# demo client is under xmlBlaster\demo\activex 

  Visual Studio:
    -> Solution Explorer -> References -> (right mouse): Add Reference -> COM -> XmlScriptAccess

  Task bar: Java Icon:
    -> Open Console


TODO:

- Finish the work

- Fix HSQLDB driver loading problem

- Implement callback events
