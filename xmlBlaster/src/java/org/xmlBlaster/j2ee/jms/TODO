Decisions have to be taken regarding the following:
- how to separate queues from ptp clients
- sessions and session pools: how to deal with persistent subscriptions
  and how to handle reconnection to an anonymous session (i.e. such one which 
  was assigned by the server side: negative public session Id).
  

Tasks to be done in the near future:
- implement client properties of type object in the qos
- check if the mapping for priorities is correct (message)
- check if the timestamp mapping is correct (are we using x1000000 ?)
- checking the naming for queues and topics
- add key client tags for the topics
- clear up what is the sense of having a setRedelivered in the message (should
  it overwrite the serverside retries ?)
- setJMSReplyTo: should it be allowed to reply to topics, does the sender
  really work or is it overwritten by the client library ?
- in messsage add in setters and getters for properties the xmlBlaster specific ones too.
- check if the settings of the publisher are stronger or weaker from the ones
  set in the message.
