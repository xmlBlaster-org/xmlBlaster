Overview of the xmlBlaster.org packages
=======================================

1. The xmlBlaster.idl generates three directories:

   - authenticateIdl
     The CORBA interface to login and logout

   - serverIdl
     The CORBA interface of the xmlBlaster server.
     All files in this directory are automatically generated
     only ServerImpl.java is handcrafted

   - clientIdl
     The CORBA callback interface for the client (demo)
     All files in this directory are automatically generated
     only BlasterCallbackImpl.java is handcrafted

2. The directory 'util' contains some helper classes
    which are used by the server.
   They may also be used by clients, but you are free to use
    or not to use them.


3. The directory 'engine' contains the xmlBlaster server code.


4. The directory 'authentication' contains the login/logout code


5. Main.java is used to invoke the xmlBlaster server:

      jaco org.xmlBlaster.Main

   Don't forget to start the JacORB Name Service 'ns' before.

   Optionally you can also start the server with

      jaco org.xmlBlaster.MainGUI

   which pops up a button to quit the server


6. Client.java may be used as a first test client:

     jaco org.xmlBlaster.Client
