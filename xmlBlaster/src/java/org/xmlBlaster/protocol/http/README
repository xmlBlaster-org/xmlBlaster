This is the framework to allow callbacks from xmlBlaster to browsers.

NOTE: Work is in progress, it is not totally finished.

If you don't have the JSDK (java servlet development kit from Sun)
installed, this will not compile.
Just ignore the warnings in this case.

The servlets connects to xmlBlaster using CORBA
and to the browser using a persistent http connection
(using a hidden frame to communicate).

The messages are directly transferred to the browser, which has a
XML parser and notifies the interested browser frames about the callback.
For Javascript examples see the javascript directory.
