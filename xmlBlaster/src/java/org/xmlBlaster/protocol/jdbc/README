Ok, so this is a quick and dirty 'HOWTO' for the DB adapter.

First things first.  Do an update and do a make all.

Add the following line to your xmlBlaster.properties file:
JDBCDrivers=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver,org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver,postgresql.Driver

It is a comma delimited list of databse drivers.  Use as many
as you
like.
The appropriate driver class files(jar) must be in your
classpath.
(If you are using jdk 1.2, having the jar file in jre/lib/ext
will
not do you any good.  It must be in the CLASSPATH.  This is
due
to the bootstrapping of jaco)

Start up the server (jaco org.xmlBlaster.Main)

Start up the XmlDBAdapter (jaco
org.xmlBlaster.protocol.jdbc.XmlDBAdapter)
(To exit the adapter, type 'q' in the console).

-----TESTING-----
You will need access to a database!  You can use the
XmlDBClient
unchanged
if you don't mind typing a lot.  To invoke the client, try
something
similar to
the following:

jaco javaclients.jdbc.XmlDBClient
        -url "jdbc:postgresql://24.3.47.214/postgres"
        -user postgres
        -pass secret
        -type query
        -query "select * from foo_table"
        -limit 50
        -confirm true

Options:
        -url (any valid JDBC url)
        -user (valid DB username)
        -pass (valid DB password)
        -query (any valid SQL syntax)
        -type (query|update) query by default - determines
the interaction with
db
        -confirm (true|false) true by default - when set to
true, you get an
answer
        -limit (any integer) 50 by default - used to limit
the number of rows
returned

NOTE:
        If you are querying, set your -type to 'query'.  If
you are updating
        (insert, update, delete) set -type to 'update'.
        If you are updating and don't want a confirmation,
set -confirm to
'false'.

For an example of what to expect, please look over the .xml
files
located
in demo/javaclients/jdbc.  Most exceptions are caught and
returned in
the 
appropriate xml message.  There are still one or two bugs
that need to
be squashed,
but I am working on those.

If you have any difficulty or questions, feel free to send me
