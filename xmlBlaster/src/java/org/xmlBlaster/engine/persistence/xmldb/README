Integration of Xindice (former dbXML) into xmlBlaster as persistence plugin
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

STATE:      - beta
            - runs stable, afaik
            - no experience till now, except in development environment
            - needs own classloader to be implemented, conflicts with more
              ORBs in CLASSPATH. see Mailinglist


RESOURCES:  http://www.xindice.org or
            http://xml.apache.org/xindice/
            http://www.xmlBlaster.org


TRAPS/BUGS: What is with BLOBs?
            How can we store best binary data?
            Xindice-persistence-plugin has been tested successfully on following platforms:
            OS                                  JDK
            Linux SuSE 7.2                      1.3.1_02 HotSpot(TM) (build 1.3.1_02-b02, mixed mode) // needs: 'ulimit -s 2048'
            Linux SuSE 7.2/3                    1.4.0 HotSpot(TM) (build 1.4.0-b92, mixed mode)

TODO:       Need to finish Test-case! (need to implemet CLASSLOADER before)
            Run Xindice embedded


EXAMPLE:    Find an example in the section 'See another example here:' later in this file.



To use it, you need a Xindice installed and running
(tested and developed with Xindice 1.0rc2 (Pepper)).
It its planned to run xindice ebedded in xmlBlaster so you do not
need to care where and how to get it. Unfortunately, this is not done by now.

Till then you need to get Xindice by yourself.


Where to get:
=============

1. packed

   The release 1.0rc2 (Pepper) has been released on Feb 26th 2002. This will be shipped
   with xmlBlaster till a final release 1.0 is available.
   You can get a copy @ http://www.xindice.org

2. cvs

   Can be checked out as follows:

        Xindice is also available via Anonymous CVS access.
        You can perform a checkout with the following settings:

        CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic
        cvs login (password is anoncvs)
        cvs co xml-xindice

        Build Xindice as described in $XINDICE_HOME/INSTALL


Start and prepare Xindice:
==========================

1. start

   $XINDICE_HOME/start

   you should see something like:

        Starting Xindice
        ----------------

        Xindice 1.0rc2 (Pepper)

        Database: 'db' initializing
        Script: 'GET' added to script storage
        Service: 'db' started
        Service: 'HTTPServer' started @ http://localhost:4080/
        Service: 'APIService' started

        Server Running

   Everything is ok now.

2. create a collection

   Create a collection manually by:

        xindiceadmin ac -c /db -n xmlBlaster

        Created : /db/xmlBlaster

3. List the created collection

   List collections:

        xindice lc -c /db

                xmlBlaster
                system

        Total collections: 2


Prepare and start xmlBlaster:
=============================

1. edit properties

   Copy the config/xmlblaster.properties.templates to $HOME/xmlBlaster.properties and/or edit
   it manually. You need to activate:

        Persistence.LazyRecovery=true

        Persistence.Driver.Type=xmldb
        Persistence.Driver.Version=xindice
        Persistence.Path=xmldb:xindice:///db
        Persistence.Collection=xmlBlaster


2. Start xmlBlaster

   Start the xmlBlaster as described in $XMLBLASTER_HOME/INSTALL

        if you can see something like:
        .
        .
        [Feb 7, 2002 10:50:36 PM INFO  XMLDBPlugin] using collectionPath 'xmldb:xindice:///db/xmlBlaster'
        [Feb 7, 2002 10:50:37 PM INFO  PluginManagerBase] Plugin 'org.xmlBlaster.engine.persistence.xmldb.XMLDBPlugin' successfully initialized!
        [Feb 7, 2002 10:50:37 PM INFO  RequestBroker] Loaded persistence driver '[xmldb][xindice]'
        [Feb 7, 2002 10:50:37 PM INFO  XMLDBPlugin] Successfully got 1 stored message-oids from xmldb:xindice:///db/xmlBlaster
        .
        .

   you are on the right way ;-)
   It says which plugin the persistence layer is using and that it got 1 message
   restored from it. This may differ on your system. In fact it is 0, if you
   try this the very first time (of course ;-).


How to use it from the client:
==============================

1. set the isDurable in qos

   Publish some messages which are tagged 'isDurable', you can do this by using
   the qos-tag:

      String qos = "<qos>" +
                   "   <isDurable />" +
                   "</qos>";

2. manual check

   Check, if you want, by using for example
   $ xindice ld -c /db/xmlBlaster

        amIdurable-XmlCon.xml
        amIdurable-XmlKey.xml
        amIdurable-XmlQos.xml

   Total documents: 3

   and list a single content by using:
   $ xindice rd -c /db/xmlBlaster -n amIdurable-XmlKey.xml

   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <key oid="amIdurable" contentMime="text/plain">
   </key>


3. generell usage

   Now you can subscribe to your messages and see if they arrive well.

   After restarting xmlBlaster all messages tagged durable should be able to
   subscribe to without being published now.


See another example here:
=========================


1. Feed some messages to the xmlBlaster

        cd $XMLBLASTER_HOME/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/client/feeder

        java org.xmlBlaster.client.feeder.PublishFile -c Hello.txt -k Hello-Key.xml -q Hello-Qos.xml

   Check the message in the persistence layer if you want with the this command, if you like:

   $ xindice ld -c /db/xmlBlaster

        Hello.txt-XmlCon.xml
        Hello.txt-XmlKey.xml
        Hello.txt-XmlQos.xml

   Total documents: 3

2. Read the message from xmlBlaster

        cd $XMLBLASTER_HOME/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/client/reader

        java org.xmlBlaster.client.reader.SubscribeMessage -loginName Tim -passwd secret -oid Hello.txt

        ============= START Hello.txt =======================
        [Feb 7, 2002 10:55:50 PM INFO  SubscribeMessage] Receiving update of a message ...
        <xmlBlaster>
        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <key oid="Hello.txt" contentMime="text/plain">

             <TestTag>
              </TestTag>
           </key>

        <content>
        Hello world

        </content>

           <qos> <!-- UpdateQos -->
              <state id='OK'/>
              <sender>
                 PublishFile
              </sender>
              <subscribe id='__subId:1'/>
              <rcvTimestamp millis='1013118850714' nanos='0'>
                 2002-02-07 22:54:10.714
              </rcvTimestamp>
              <expiration timeToLive='129287067'/>
           </qos>

        </xmlBlaster>
        ============= END Hello.txt =========================


3. restart xmlBlaster

   After restarting the xmlBlaster reading of the message should just
   bring the same result.

   See $XMLBLASTER_HOME/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/client/feeder/README and
   $XMLBLASTER_HOME/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/client/reader/README for
   more details on this example.

4. check manual

   You can check the content of the Xindice database by using the commandline interface:

   See the collections:

        xindice lc -c /db

                xmlBlaster
                system

        Total collections: 2

   See the content/documents of the xmlBlaster-collection:

        xindice ld -c /db/xmlBlaster

                Hello.txt-XmlCon.xml
                Hello.txt-XmlKey.xml
                Hello.txt-XmlQos.xml

        Total documents: 3

   See the document with the key Hello.txt-XmlCon.xml

        xindice rd -c /db/xmlBlaster -n Hello.txt-XmlCon.xml

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <content><![CDATA[Hello world
        ]]></content>

   You can see here that the data 'Hello world' are stored within a CDATA-Section.
   This works for 99% of all cases but what happens with BLOBs or other binary data,
   if a ']]' comes before the datapart is finished?
