# Starting the java interpreter, using JacORB omg libs instead of those
# from JDK 1.2
#
#   Basically, you don't need this script anymore, calling java or javac
#   directly is enough - if you are using JDK 1.1 or, for JDK 1.2,
#   installed the orb.properties file correctly. If this was not
#   possible, you need to set and pass the system properties 
#   org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass and org.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass on 
#   the command line. For convenience, you can use this script
#
#   Copy orb.properties to JAVA_HOME/lib or edit the existing
#   orb.properties file. Then you don't need this script.
