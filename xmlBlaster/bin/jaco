# Starting the java interpreter, using JacORB omg libs instead of those
# from JDK 1.2
#
#   Basically, you don't need this script anymore, calling java or javac
#   directly is enough - if you are using JDK 1.1 or, for JDK 1.2,
#   installed the orb.properties file correctly. If this was not
#   possible, you need to set and pass the system properties 
#   org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass and org.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass on 
#   the command line. For convenience, you can use this script
#
#   Copy orb.properties to JAVA_HOME/lib or edit the existing
#   orb.properties file. Then you don't need this script.
#
# NOTE: If you want to use the naming service, you need to use jaco,
#       which sets the -Xbootclasspath
#       since otherwise the wrong NamingContext from JDK is used.
#       If your code uses NamingContextExt instead of NamingContext
#       you don't need -Xbootclasspath:${JacORB_HOME}/lib/jacorb.jar
#
# NOTE: If you use the RMI server, you should adjust the security policy
#       file ${XMLBLASTER_HOME}/config/xmlBlaster.policy

# Variant loading the xmlBlaster.policy via CLASSPATH (if you use RMI):
#export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$XMLBLASTER_HOME/config
