The XmlBlaster is an XML based MOM (message-oriented
Middleware) which comes with LGPL. XmlBlaster is a pure Java

Communication with the server is based on CORBA, RMI, XML-RPC or SOCKET
and subscribers can use XPath expressions to filter the messages
they wish to receive.

Examples for C++, Java, Perl and Python clients are provided.
