use in any application.

XmlBlaster  is  a  pure Java publish/subscribe MOM server which
exchanges  any messages between publishers and subscribers, the
topics have a meta description using XML and are queryable with
XPath.  Message  instances can be queried with XPath or regular
expression  filter  plugins  (full  text search) or with SQL 92
conditions.

Communication  with  the  server  is  based on CORBA, XMLRPC or
SOCKET  and  examples for C, C++, Java, PHP, VB.net, C#, Python
