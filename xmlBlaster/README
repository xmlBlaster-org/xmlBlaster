XmlBlaster is a pure Java publish/subscribe MOM server
(message-oriented middleware) which exchanges XML-encoded
messages between publishers and subscribers.

Communication with the server is based on CORBA (using JacORB), and
subscribers can use XPath expressions to filter the messages they
wish to receive. 

xmlBlaster uses the Sun XML parser for XML parsing, and XT from
James Clark for XSL parsing.

For installation see INSTALL file.

The query language for xmlBlaster is XPath.
For detailed information about XPath refer to the following URL

  XPath: http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath
