The XmlBlaster is an XML based MOM (message-oriented
middleware) which comes under the LGPL license to be free to use
in any application.
XmlBlaster is a pure Java publish/subscribe MOM server which exchanges
any messages between publishers and subscribers, the messages have a
meta description using XML and are queryable with XPath.

Communication with the server is based on CORBA, RMI, XMLRPC or SOCKET
and subscribers can use XPath expressions to filter the messages
they wish to receive.

Examples for C, C++, Java, PHP, Python and Perl clients are provided.

To install and getting started with xmlBlaster read the INSTALL file.

XmlBlaster uses the Sun XML parser for XML parsing, and XT from
James Clark for XSL parsing.

The query language for xmlBlaster is XPath. For detailed information
