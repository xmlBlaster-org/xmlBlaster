These are examples on how to access xmlBlaster from a C++ client

- clientBOA.cc and clientPOA.cc use the MICO (C++) CORBA library

- xmlBlaster runs with JacORB (Java)


1.) Install MICO (2.3) and set the environment variable to point to MICO

   export MICO_HOME=/usr/local/mico


2) Compile the clients with

   make all



To run the clients:


Using BOA (clientBOA.cc):


3) Start the xmlBlaster server

	 jaco org.xmlBlaster.Main -iorFile /tmp/NS_Ref


4) And connect with the C++ client

	 ./clientBOA `cat /tmp/NS_Ref`


Using POA (clientPOA.cc):


3) Start the xmlBlaster server 

	jaco org.xmlBlaster.Main


4) And connect with the C++ client

	./clientPOA -ORBNamingIOR `cat /tmp/ior.dat`


NOTE: change /tmp/ior.dat with the name of the file containing the IOR for the
naming service (which you must have started before xmlBlaster).
