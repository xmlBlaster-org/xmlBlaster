This is an example to access xmlBlaster from a C++ callback

- client.cc uses the MICO (C++) CORBA library
- xmlBlaster runs with JacORB (Java)


1.) Install MICO (2.3) and set the environment variable to point to MICO

   export MICO_HOME=/usr/local/mico


2) Compile the client with

   make all


3) Start the xmlBlaster server

	 ${JacORB_HOME}/bin/jaco org.xmlBlaster.Main /tmp/NS_Ref


4) And connect with the C++ client

	 ./client `cat /tmp/NS_Ref`
