This is an example to access xmlBlaster from a Perl client

- client uses the COPE (Perl) CORBA library

- xmlBlaster runs with JacORB (Java)


1.) Install COPE (0.50_51) and set the PATH variable to point to idl2perl

   export PATH=${PATH}_/usr/bin


2) Generate idl perl stubs with:

   make all


3) Start the xmlBlaster server

	 ${JacORB_HOME}/bin/jaco org.xmlBlaster.Main /tmp/NS_Ref


4) And connect with the Perl client

	 ./client `cat /tmp/NS_Ref`


NOTE: Callbacks are not possible in the current COPE Perl library.
      So the publisher of a message can't be receiver of its own sent message
		as well.
		The COPE CORBA library will be extended in the near future to support
		client callbacks.
		For the time being, you need to implement a multi threaded perl client
		to allow callbacks to oneself.
