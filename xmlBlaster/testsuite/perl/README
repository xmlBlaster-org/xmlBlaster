This is an example to access xmlBlaster from a Perl client

- client uses the COPE (Perl) CORBA library

- xmlBlaster runs with JacORB (Java)


1.) Install COPE (0.50_51) and set the PATH variable to point to idl2perl

   export PATH=${PATH}_/usr/bin


2) Generate idl perl stubs with:

   make all


3) Start the xmlBlaster server

	 ${JacORB_HOME}/bin/jaco org.xmlBlaster.Main /tmp/NS_Ref


4) And connect with the Perl client

	 ./client `cat /tmp/NS_Ref`
