Bom dia,

the new release 0.848 is out (May, 23. 2003).

We wait with the stable release 0.85 until we got feedback about 0.848


IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------

1. Many property names changed!
   Please read accurate xmlBlaster/CHANGES and search & replace all
   your outdated environment settings!

2. Remove your old xmlBlaster.properties, xmlBlasterPlugins.xml
   and jacorb.properties files.
   Use the new files from directory xmlBlaster/config.
  
3. Backward compatibility:
  * XmlRpc client and server is not backward compatible to 0.847
    as the XML-RPC protocol was renamed to XMLPRC

4. The default setup of xmlBlaster runs RAM based only,
   there is no persistence for crash recovery.
   To switch it on you need Postgres or Oracle installed, see
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.postgres.html
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.oracle.html
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.html
   and read the NOTE in xmlBlaster.properties.
   This way you get swapping support for huge message amount
   and persistence messages to survive server crashes.


NEW FEATURES:
-------------

o  Properties renamed to match the new hierarchical syntax.

o  Bug fixes.

o  A C bases SOCKET client with only 25 kByte of size
   (currently for synchronous access only).

o  Please read the CHANGES file for more informations.


KNOWN BUGS:
-----------

1. telnet/remoteconsole loops forever after shutdown of embeeded xmlBlaster
   (switch off in such a case with -admin.remoteconsole.port 0)

2. On some JDK 1.2x variants there is a delay of 10 seconds on client login.
   The reason is not known.

3. C++ clients with MICO 2.37 and 2.3.8: If you invoke XmlBlasterAccess::shutdown on one XmlBlasterAccess
   instance, you will not receive any callbacks anymore from any other instance of that class. This problem
   does NOT exist with TAO or ORBIX.

NEXT RELEASES:
--------------

The next release is 0.85 and we strive to have these additional changes:

  o Bug fixes

  o Cleanup of obsolete packages


The planned features of release 0.9 are an open issue.

enjoy,

The xmlBlaster.org maintainers
