Salute,

the new release 0.845 is out (Mar, 27. 2003).
(We wait with 0.85 until we got feedback about 0.845)

XmlBlaster is maturing to industrial strength.

We are now on the way to be a valid alternative to commercial MoMs
such as MQSeries and SonicMQ.

In many of the features we are already far ahead, some others are still missing
(like transaction support and a SWING administration console).


IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------

1. Edit xmlBlaster/build.properties to
  compile the C++ clients or to use jikes.

2. Remove your old xmlBlaster.properties, xmlBlasterPlugins.xml
  and jacorb.properties files.
  Use the new files from directory xmlBlaster/config.
  
3. Backward compatibility:
  * xmlBlaster 0.845 has changes to the client API (Java)
    Please read 
      xmlBlaster/CHANGES
    and study
      xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/HelloWorld3.java
    as an example.

4. The default setup of xmlBlaster runs RAM based only,
  there is no persistence for crash recovery.
  To switch it on you need Postgres or Oracle installed, see
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.postgres.html
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.oracle.html
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.html
  and read the NOTE in xmlBlaster.properties.
  This way you get swapping support for huge message amount
  and persistence messages to survive server crashes.


NEW FEATURES:
-------------

1. Bug fixes

2. New client configuration tutorial:
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.configuration.html

3. Redesigned runlevel manager which loads plugins as
   described in xmlBlasterPlugins.xml, see
   http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.runlevel.html

4. The powerful queue framework is now emebedded into the Java client library.
   This supports persistence for crash recovery, swapping and cashing.

Please read the CHANGES file for more informations.


KNOWN BUGS:
-----------

1. telnet/remoteconsole loops forever after shutdown of embeeded xmlBlaster
   (switch off in such a case with -admin.remoteconsole.port 0)

2. On some JDK 1.2x variants there is a delay of 10 seconds on client login.
   The reason is not known.

3. C++ clients with MICO 2.37 and 2.3.8: If you invoke XmlBlasterAccess::shutdown on one XmlBlasterAccess
   instance, you will not receive any callbacks anymore from any other instance of that class. This problem
   does NOT exist with TAO or ORBIX.

NEXT RELEASES:
--------------

The next release is 0.85 and we strive to have these additional changes:

1. Performance profiling and extended stress tests

2. An embedded JDBC database additionally to Postgres and Oracle.

3. Finish port to new property syntax


The planned features of release 0.9 are an open issue.

enjoy,
