This is xmlBlaster version 0.9 *stable*

You  get  many new goodies, a complete C++ access layer, stable
access  from  good old C, a tiny applet example, a complete xml
script  access layer, many bug fixes (most for PtP messages and
heavy swapping) and much more.

XmlBlaster  is  under development or productive in a huge range
of  industries  like  satellite  control,  air  traffic control
telecommunication, radar, car industry, process monitoring etc.

This  release  is backward compatible to the previous regarding
the  client  server  communication protocols (except the markup
subscribeable was renamed to subscribable).

The  Java/C/C++  access  libraries  (client side API) have some
incompatibilities  which  your  compiler will tell you (details
are in the CHANGES file).

It   is   tested   under   Linux/Solaris-SPARC/WinXP  with  JDK
(1.2)1.3-1.5  and  g++  2.9x/3.x, icc 8, MSVisualC++ from 2003,
SunCC    compilers.    There    is    no   reason   why   other
platforms/compilers should not work, just try it.

It  is  leak  checked  in  RAM  and  on  persistence  store for
Java,C,C++.

Please use the new xmlBlaster.properties file.
