Salute,

the new release 0.841 is out (Jan, 23. 2003).
(We wait with 0.85 until we got feedback about 0.841)

XmlBlaster is maturing to industrial strength.

We are now on the way to be a valid alternative to commercial MoMs
such as MQSeries and SonicMQ.

In many of the features we are already far ahead, some others are still missing
(like transaction support and a SWING administration console).


IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------

1. Remove your old xmlBlaster.properties, jacorb.properties
  and orb.properties files.
  Use the new files from directory xmlBlaster/config.

2. Backward compatibility:
  * xmlBlaster 0.841 has got changes to the client API (Java and C++)
    Please read 
      xmlBlaster/CHANGES
    and study
      xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/HelloWorld3.java
    as an example.

3. The default setup of xmlBlaster runs RAM based only,
  there is no persistence for crash recovery.
  To switch it on you need Postgres or Oracle installed, see
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.postgres.html
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.oracle.html
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.html
  and read the NOTE in xmlBlaster.properties.
  This way you get swapping support for huge message amount
  and persistence messages to survive server crashes.

KNOWN BUGS:
-----------

1. telnet/remoteconsole loops forever after shutdown of embeeded xmlBlaster
   (switch off in such a case with -admin.remoteconsole.port 0)


NEXT RELEASES:
--------------

The next release is 0.85 and we strive to have these additional changes:

1. The new queue framework is embedded to the Java client library
   (inclusive the dispatcher plugin framework)

2. Sessions and subcriptions are made persistent to survive a server crash

3. History message access will be better documented and more
   query options are implemented

4. Performance profiling and extended memory leak checks

5. An embedded JDBC database additionally to Postgres and Oracle.

6. Finish port to new property syntax (see mailing list discussion).


The release 0.9 will (hopefully) contain:

1. Cluster mirroring of sessions and subscriptions (additionally to the
   already functional message mirroring).

2. Load balancing in cluster environment

3. Finishing SNMP support (it is partially coded already).

4. User plugins startable at configurable runlevels by the Runlevel manager.
   (Supporting administrative topic creation and many other things).

5. A SWING based frontend to control and configure xmlBlaster clusters.
