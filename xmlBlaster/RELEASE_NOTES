Salute,

the new release 0.842 is out (Feb, 21. 2003).
(We wait with 0.85 until we got feedback about 0.842)

XmlBlaster is maturing to industrial strength.

We are now on the way to be a valid alternative to commercial MoMs
such as MQSeries and SonicMQ.

In many of the features we are already far ahead, some others are still missing
(like transaction support and a SWING administration console).


IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------

If you upgrade from 0.841:

1. Edit xmlBlaster/build.properties to
  compile the C++ clients or to use jikes.

If you upgrade from 0.840 or older:

1. Remove your old xmlBlaster.properties, jacorb.properties files.
  Use the new files from directory xmlBlaster/config.

2. Backward compatibility:
  * xmlBlaster 0.841 had changes to the client API (Java and C++)
    Please read 
      xmlBlaster/CHANGES
    and study
      xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/HelloWorld3.java
    as an example.

3. The default setup of xmlBlaster runs RAM based only,
  there is no persistence for crash recovery.
  To switch it on you need Postgres or Oracle installed, see
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.postgres.html
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.oracle.html
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.html
  and read the NOTE in xmlBlaster.properties.
  This way you get swapping support for huge message amount
  and persistence messages to survive server crashes.


NEW FEATURES:
-------------

1. Full client side C++ support (by Michele Laghi, Marting Johnson, Marcel Ruff and others)
  * It is known to run on Linux/Solaris/Windows with g++ 2.9x/3.x, VC7 and more.
  * See 
      http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.cpp.html
      http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/src/c++/doc/html/ 
      xmlBlaster/src/c++
      xmlBlaster/testsuite/src/c++

2. Many server side bug fixes

Please read the CHANGES file for more informations.


KNOWN BUGS:
-----------

1. telnet/remoteconsole loops forever after shutdown of embeeded xmlBlaster
   (switch off in such a case with -admin.remoteconsole.port 0)

2. On some JDK 1.2x variants there is a delay of 10 seconds on client login.
   The reason is not known.

3. C++ clients with MICO 2.37 and 2.3.8: If you invoke XmlBlasterAccess::shutdown on one XmlBlasterAccess
   instance, you will not receive any callbacks anymore from any other instance of that class. This problem
   does NOT exist with TAO.

NEXT RELEASES:
--------------

The next release is 0.85 and we strive to have these additional changes:

1. The new queue framework is embedded to the Java client library
   (inclusive the dispatcher plugin framework)

2. Sessions and subcriptions are made persistent to survive a server crash

3. History message access will be better documented and more
   query options are implemented

4. Performance profiling and extended memory leak checks

5. An embedded JDBC database additionally to Postgres and Oracle.

6. Finish port to new property syntax (see mailing list discussion).


The planned features of release 0.9 are an open issue.

enjoy,
