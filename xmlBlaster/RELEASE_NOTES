Bom dia,

the new release 0.849 is out (Jul, 15 2003).

We wait with the stable release 0.85 until we got feedback about 0.849


IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------

1. This update is mostly backward compatible to 0.848.
   Please read accurate xmlBlaster/CHANGES for details.

2. Remove your old xmlBlaster.properties, xmlBlasterPlugins.xml
   and jacorb.properties files.
   Use the new files from directory xmlBlaster/config.
  

NEW FEATURES:
-------------

o  We use now HSQLDB as our default embedded database.

o  Bug fixes.

o  Please read the CHANGES file for more informations.


KNOWN BUGS:
-----------

1. telnet/remoteconsole loops forever after shutdown of embeeded xmlBlaster
   (switch off in such a case with -admin.remoteconsole.port 0)

2. On some JDK 1.2x variants there is a delay of 10 seconds on client login.
   The reason is not known.


NEXT RELEASES:
--------------

0.849 is already considered stable for production use.

As we have reached the minor version number '9' the next
release is the long waited stable release 0.85.

This is the 0.85 beta release.

For 0.85 we try to resolve the JacORB deadlock
bug which occurres in seldom circumstances
during login,

enjoy,

The xmlBlaster.org maintainers
