This is xmlBlaster version 1.0.4 Xmas 2005-07-04


XmlBlaster  is  under development or productive in a huge range
of  industries  like  satellite  control,  air  traffic control
telecommunication, radar, car industry, process monitoring etc.

This  release  is backward compatible to the previous regarding
the client server communication protocols.
It contains some bug fixes and some smaller refinements.

It  is  tested under Linux/Solaris-SPARC/FreeBSD/WinXP with JDK
(1.2)1.3-1.5  and g++ 2.9x/3.x/4.0.0, icc 8.x, MSVisualC++ from
2003,  MSVisualC++8  2005  beta2,  SunCC compilers. There is no
reason  why other platforms/compilers should not work, just try
it.

Persistence  is checked  against  Oracle 9i and 10g,  different 
Postgres versions, MS-SQLServer and hsqldb.

It  is  leak  checked  in  RAM  and  on  persistence  store for
Java,C,C++.

================
JDK 1.3 support:
================

The  current  xmlBlaster  release  compiles with JDK 1.4 or 1.5
only. This is due to the used ant libraries.

If  compiled  with  JDK 1.4 the binaries will run fine with JDK
1.3, 1.4 and 1.5, however if compiled with JDK 1.5 the binaries
will run with JDK 1.4 and 1.5 and not with JDK 1.3.

The  distribution  is  compiled with JDK 1.4 and runs fine on a
JDK 1.3 runtime envrionment.


=============================
IMPORTANT COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
=============================

The JDBC tables have changed incompatible from 0.903 to 0.91.

  -> Removed XB_NODES table (is backward compatible)
  -> Removed XB_QUEUES table (is backward compatible)
  -> Removed column 'nodeId' from XB_ENTRIES (is NOT backward compatible)

     There is now only a single table (PostgreSQL example):

     CREATE TABLE xb_entries (
       dataId bigint,
       queueName text,
       prio integer,
       flag text,
       durable char(1),
       byteSize bigint,
       blob bytea,
       PRIMARY KEY (dataId, queueName)

If you need to upgrade xmlBlaster having legacy data in your database
do manually a

   ALTER TABLE xb_entries DROP COLUMN nodeId'

Otherwise just drop all old database tables
 (for HSQLDB remove its files in the tmp directory, on Windows the
  default %HOMEPATH%\tmp location for user 'joe' is
  "C:\Documents and Settings\joe\tmp"
  and on Linux "$HOME/tmp")

If you forget this the exception text is something like:

   [Aug 28, 2004 2:47:15 PM ERROR XmlBlaster.MainThread org.xmlBlaster.engine.msgstore.cache.PersistenceCachePlugin-topicStore:xmlBlaster_192_168_1_4_3412]
   put: an error occured when writing to the persistent queue, the persistent entry __sys__UserList/2004-08-28 14:47:15.814 will temporarly be handled as transient.
   Is the DB up and running ?
