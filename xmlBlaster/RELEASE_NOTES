Bom dia,

the new release 0.85d beta is out (Oct, 12 2003).

We wait with the stable release 0.85 until we got feedback about 0.85d


IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------

1. This update is backward compatible to 0.849
   Please read xmlBlaster/CHANGES for details.
   It is recommended to use the new xmlBlaster.properties
   to get the nicer exception logging formatting.

2. For older updates remove your old xmlBlaster.properties,
   xmlBlasterPlugins.xml and jacorb.properties files.
   Use the new files from directory xmlBlaster/config.
  

NEW FEATURES:
-------------

o  Bug fixes.

o  Please read the CHANGES file for more informations.


KNOWN BUGS:
-----------

1. telnet/remoteconsole loops forever after shutdown of embeeded xmlBlaster
   (switch off in such a case with -admin.remoteconsole.port 0)

2. JacORB deadlock in seldom cases during login


NEXT RELEASES:
--------------

0.85d beta is already considered stable for production use.

For 0.85 we try to resolve the JacORB deadlock
bug which occurres in seldom circumstances
during login,

enjoy,

The xmlBlaster.org maintainers
