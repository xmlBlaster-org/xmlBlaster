Bom dia,

the new release 0.847 is out (May, 12. 2003).

We wait with stable release 0.85 until we got feedback about 0.847


IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------

1. Edit xmlBlaster/build.properties to
  compile the C++ clients or to use jikes.

2. Remove your old xmlBlaster.properties, xmlBlasterPlugins.xml
  and jacorb.properties files.
  Use the new files from directory xmlBlaster/config.
  (For upgrades of 0.844 or earlier)
  
3. Backward compatibility:
  * No incompatible changes since 0.846

4. The default setup of xmlBlaster runs RAM based only,
  there is no persistence for crash recovery.
  To switch it on you need Postgres or Oracle installed, see
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.postgres.html
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.oracle.html
    http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.html
  and read the NOTE in xmlBlaster.properties.
  This way you get swapping support for huge message amount
  and persistence messages to survive server crashes.


NEW FEATURES:
-------------

   Bug fixes

   Please read the CHANGES file for more informations.


KNOWN BUGS:
-----------

1. telnet/remoteconsole loops forever after shutdown of embeeded xmlBlaster
   (switch off in such a case with -admin.remoteconsole.port 0)

2. On some JDK 1.2x variants there is a delay of 10 seconds on client login.
   The reason is not known.

3. C++ clients with MICO 2.37 and 2.3.8: If you invoke XmlBlasterAccess::shutdown on one XmlBlasterAccess
   instance, you will not receive any callbacks anymore from any other instance of that class. This problem
   does NOT exist with TAO or ORBIX.
