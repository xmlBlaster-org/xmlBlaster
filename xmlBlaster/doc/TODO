- Performance: 
  * Implementing of  XtOmQuery for oid access (minimal data in DOM tree)
    This is nonsense, the minimal DOM tree couldn't be parsed by XPath
  * Normalizing the DOM tree

- dtd support

- Add an AuthenticateException type

- QoS support is still missing

- xmlBlaster.idl
  * rename AuthServer to AuthenticationService
  * rename Server to xmlBlaster

- reliability of update() callback
  The update() method is declared oneway, so the xmlBlaster
  can't guarantee if the update is delivered.

  Perhaps there should be 2 update variants,
  one blocking (no keyword oneway) and one none-blocking (with keyword oneway).
  
  In the blocking mode, xmlBlaster would need a timeout
  or an extra thread per update client, so that not
  one client can block the whole update sequence.
