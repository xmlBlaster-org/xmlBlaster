            Subscribe to the mailing list and discuss your ideas.
            And - very important - start hacking.<p />
            If you don't like the guidelines, discuss it on the mailing list,
            enhance them or change them if it makes sense and respects the other
            core developer feelings.<p />
            Coding/documentation should be in English.

            Follow the common look and feel of xmlBlaster.<br />
            We don't use any tabs for indenting, indenting is done with
            3 blanks per level.
            We know, this discussion is as old as mankind.
            But we choose for xmlBlaster this way.

         <p class=celltitel><a NAME="testing"></a>Testing - for every feature, a test case.<p />
            We have a test suite for xmlBlaster, you find it under 
            xmlBlaster/testsuite/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/test.<br />
            Please add a test case there for everything you code.<p />
            Because many people develop xmlBlaster, and you develop for the world,
            we need a full automatic test suite.<p />
            Like this, before committing changes, run the tests, and if the
            test suite shows 'green' we can sleep well.<p />
            Believe it or not, this is a MUCH more relaxed developing style.
            Imagine you make changes or enhancements in somebody else code. You dare
            much easier to do so, if you know the test suite reports if you broke some parts
            of the code you didn't understand or wasn't aware of.<p />
            Please minimize manual tests on the screen, nobody will run them. There is
            hopefully always a possibility to test your feature automatically with the test suite.
            <h3>
            Steps for testing
            </h3>
            <p><b>
            You need to start Postgres or Oracle for persistent storage
            to run the tests, otherwise most tests will fail, see 
            <a href="http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.postgres.html" target="others">Postgres</a>
            or 
            <a href="http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.oracle.html" target="others">Oracle</a>.
            <p></b>
            <pre>
   cd xmlBlaster
   build delete
   build all        (compile the server and the Java clients)
   build c          (compile the C client library for testing)

   build runTests
            </pre>
            <p>To get a HTML based test report please invoke after <i>runTests</i>:
            <pre>
   build report

   Open in your browser:

   xmlBlaster/doc/test/report/html/index.html
            </pre>
            <p>
            <b>NOTE:</b> During development you often want to run only some specific
            tests manually. Here is an example to run the <i>topic</i> specific tests
            manually (after compiling everything with <i>build all</i>):
            </p>
            <pre>
   cd xmlBlaster/testsuite/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/test/topic
   export CLASSPATH=../../../../../../lib/xmlBlaster.jar:../../../../../../lib/junit.jar
   java junit.swingui.TestRunner -noloading org.xmlBlaster.test.topic.AllTests
            </pre>
            <h3>Adding a single new test</h3>
            <p>
            Every test needs to be added to the <i>AllTests.java</i> file
            to be automatically invoked. See for example 
            <i>xmlBlaster/testsuite/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/test/topic/AllTests.java</i>
            </p>
            <h3>Adding new test subdirectories</h3>
            <p>
            If you add a new subdirectory to <i>xmlBlaster/testsuite/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/test</i>
            for a group of new tests you should add it to the <i>runJunit</i> task
            in <i>xmlBlaster/build.xml</i>, e.g.:
            <pre>
   &lt;test name="org.xmlBlaster.test.MYNEWTESTS.AllTests" fork="yes" todir="${report.dir}"/>
            </pre>
            </p>
            <h3>Testing client libraries other than Java</h3>
            <p>
            To have the tests of client libraries for C, C++, Python etc.
            integrated into the HTML report you need to add a little wrapper
            around your native coded tests. You can use the C client library 
            wrapper as an example, see <i>xmlBlaster/testsuite/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/test/C/TestC.java</i>
            </p>

      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td>
         <p class=celltitel><a NAME="changes"></a>CHANGES</p>
            Please add a short note about your change to the
            <a href="http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/CHANGES" target="Content">xmlBlaster/CHANGES</a> file.<p />
         </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td>
         <p class=celltitel><a NAME="require"></a>Requirements</p>
            Here you see how the requirements are presented <a href="../requirements/requirement.html" target="Content">online</a>.<p />
            In the directory xmlBlaster/doc/requirements there is one xml file for every xmlBlaster requirement.<p />
            Please take a copy of one of those, and note your feature in there.
            It takes you one minute but allows us to track exactly the state of xmlBlaster.<p />
            With XSL style sheets we will generate
            <ul>
               <li>
                  A html table of supported features in xmlBlaster
               </li>
               <li>
                  A list of open topics, where developers can pick some and code it
               </li>
               <li>
                  A printable reference manual from xmlBlaster
               </li>
               <li>
                  And maybe some other nice with XSL generated output
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            We are lazy, and this approach is simple and can be done with any vi editor.<p />
            The requirement should have a pointer to the testsuite, where this requirement is
            enforced.
            </p>
            <p>
            To compile the requirements from XML to nicer HTML use our ant task:
            </p>
            <pre>
   cd xmlBlaster
   build requirements
            </pre>
            <p>
            Now for every <i>.xml</i> requirement file a <i>.html</i> counterpart is generated in directory
            <i>xmlBlaster/doc/requirements</i>. You should only commit the <i>.xml</i> file to subversion
            as the html files are generated automatically on our homepage server at midnight.
            </p>
