The Java package structure for xmlBlaster
=========================================
Version:   $Id: packages.txt,v 1.1 2000/10/07 15:44:12 kron Exp $

- The 'engine' section is the implementation of xmlBlaster

  * The xml2java contains the java classes which parse the xml
    messages. The will be removed as soon as the Java-XML mapping
    is specified and performing open source tools are available
    to do this task automatically.

  - The 'persistence' section is the persistence of the xmlBlaster.
    I_PersistenceDriver is the interface for any persistence implementations.

    * The 'mudb' section is a transparent Layer for the engine. Message
      Units and QoS are stored in a file-database if the QoS-Tag "isDurable"
      is set. MessageUnits and QoS perform a PMessageUnit which is
      cached in the Memory and mapped on the disk with COPY-BACK-Caching.
      Your can query, update, delete, insert, recover MessageUnits.

    * The 'filestore' section is a simple file-database with NO caching.
      You can erase, recover and store Messages in files.

- The 'protocol' section is how the client can access xmlBlaster
  and how the xmlBlaster can callback to the client.
  These different protocols are the only way to access xmlBlaster

  * The corba package (iiop protocol) contains the formal description
    of the xmlBlaster interface (see xmlBlaster.idl)
    The generated stubs and skeletons from the idl compiler
    are dumped into sub directories of 'corba'.

  * the http protocol contains a servlet doing a browser callback
    over http.

    * The javascript package contains Javascript code which
    has to be included in the browser html page, to handle
    login/logout/publish/subscribe/update etc.
    It contains a beautiful little XML parser for Javascript from
    http://www.jeremie.com/Dev/XML/index.jer

    * The applet package contains some serialization helpers
    for applets.

- The 'acl' section for access control list implementation or delegation
  This is the authorization 'who may access what'

- The 'client' section are utilities which a Java based client
  needs always again,
  it may be helping client developers to use this toolbox
  to access xmlBlaster.
  XmlBlaster itself doesn't use any classes from here

- The 'util' section contains general helper classes
  They may be used by anybody.
