   Release notes for xmlBlaster (http://www.xmlBlaster.org)


Changes for 0.75 [???, 2000]
==============================
   - Allow clients to ping xmlBlaster, to test reliable the connection.
     The xmlBlaster.idl was extended with a ping() method.
     Java clients may use CorbaConnection.java to automatically test ping
     the connection.

   - Added <qos> tag <subscriptionId> for update messages.
     This allows the client to find out which of his subscriptions caused this
     update.

   - Added <qos> tag <state> for update messages.
     This is not finished, it always shows OK for the moment.

   - Command line parameters (args) and xmlBlaster.property file entries are
     merged. The 'args' overwrite the property file variables.
     Every xmlBlaster.property variable may as well be specified on
     command line. The leading "-" or "+" from the command line key is
     stripped before it is merged into the properties hash table.
     For example, the "-iorFile" command line argument corresponds to the
     "iorFile" variable in the xmlBlaster.properties file.
     See Property.java


Changes for 0.74 [Feb.29, 2000]
==============================
   - New XML based requirements framework.
     See xmlBlaster/doc/requirements

   - 'Fail save' client connection for Java clients added.
     Clients begin polling and automatic local recording of messages
     if xmlBlaster server disappears.
     See CorbaConnection.java

   - C++ POA demo client added [Michele]
     See xmlBlaster/testsuite/c++

   - Recorder to record/playback of messages in slow/fast motion added.
     See InvocationRecorder.java

   - CorbaConnection: logout(boolean) deprecated -> use logout() now.

   - Changed xmlBlaster.idl: messageUnit    -> msgUnit
                             messageUnitArr -> msgUnitArr
     Case does not matter, IDL is case-insensitive when detecting name clashes.
     (Thanks to Michele Laghi)

Changes for 0.72 [Feb.1, 2000]
==============================

   - Support for new QoS tag <ForceQueuing /> in PtP style.
     * Without this flag, a message published to a client which is not
       logged in throws an exception.
     * Using this flag, the message will be queued by xmlBlaster
       until the client logs in. On login, all queued messages
       are sent to the client immediately.

   - Added some simple console input mode, to control xmlBlaster
     Type <?> and <Enter> when xmlBlaster is running to get help.

   - Extended control panel GUI to support
     * dumping of xmlBlaster internal state
     * clearing the logging window
     * toggle from control panel GUI to console mode and back again

   - Bug fixed for subscribe with oid and later publish of this message.
     The BigXmlDom was not updated properly.

   - Added support for <qos><Readonly /></qos>,
     where only the first publish is accepted.

   - Added logging redirection to file,
     use on command line "-?" to query possible parameters.

   - Bug fixed for multiple login (without logout) and PtP messages.

   - Bug fixed for multiple <isDurable> messages.

   - Added missing FileDriver.erase().

   - Two bug fixes with unSubscribe() calls for previous XPATH subscriptions.

==============================

   - Added the incredible MOM slide show, see http://www.xmlBlaster.org

   - Added SubscribeKeyWrapper.java SubscribeQosWrapper.java as client helper
     to help to hide raw XML ASCII strings

   - Added simple persistent store (file based)
     Needs to be configured in $HOME/xmlBlaster.properties

   - Added a xmlBlaster.properties file (should be placed into $HOME).
     see xmlBlaster/xmlBlaster.properties.template as a base to start with

   - Renamed file names from ...QoS... to ...Qos...

   - Added a file feeder PublishFile.java (publishes files as message to xmlBlaster)
