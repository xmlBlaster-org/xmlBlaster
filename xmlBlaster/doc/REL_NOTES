   Release notes for xmlBlaster (http://www.xmlBlaster.org)
  
Changes for 0.77 [?, 2000]
===============================
   - Stripped from jacorb.jar unneeded classes.
	  This reduces the size from 3.7 MB to 2.3 MB. 

   - Bug work around for thread leak: The thread leak from
     JacORB 1.1 is for the bug being fixed in CorbaConnection.java

   - Bugfix in CorbaConnection.java: Cleanup for Callback server added.

   - Changed XML parser to jaxp 1.0.1 and added servlet support
     to xtdash.jar (from original xt.jar).

   - Changed xmlBlaster.idl
     from
        login(in string loginName, in string passwd,
              in clientIdl::BlasterCallback cb,
              in serverIdl::XmlType qos)
     to 
        login(in string loginName, in string passwd,
              in serverIdl::XmlType qos)
     The callback protocol and address is now passed using
     the xml based qos.
     NOTE: You need to change your client code as well!
     See requirement engine.qos.login.callback
     
   - CORBA implementors other than JACORB and MICO can now be used. ORBACUS 
     can work for the xmlBlaster server, java clients and c++ clients. You 
     need OB-4.0b3 (for c++) and JOB-4.0b3 (for Java) or higher. You can 
     find more about ORBACUS at http://www.ooc.com.

   - Persistent browser callback bugfixes
     * Added proper logout
     * Fixed security hole
     * Added support to set system properties through initArgs
     * Removed memory leak
     * Added ping/pong, to allow servlet to detect a lost browser


Changes for 0.76 [May.8, 2000]
===============================
   - Added a client cache to CorbaConnection class, allowing
     clients cheap synchronous polling for a message (Java only).
     See xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.cache.xml

   - Added demo for http browser callback without closing the http
     connection.
     See
         xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.browser.xml
         xmlBlaster/demo/html/systemInfo
         xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/protocol/http
     and online:
     http://www.xmlBlaster.org/systemInfo/systemInfo.html?ActionType=login&loginName=karl&passwd=secret

     Netscape 4.x on Linux/HPUX/Win and
     Netscape 4.7 / MSIE 5 on WinNT and Win98
     runs fine.

   - Bugfixes (especially memory leak fixed) in browser
     callback framework.

   - Logging output can now be customized.
     You can choose the Date and Time formatting and the
     language and country.
     The amount of logging information is adjustable as well.
     Example:
        "Saturday, April 29, 2000 7:05:49 PM GMT+02:00 INFO Published AuthServer IOR on port 7609"
     or in french:
        "samedi 29 avril 2000 19 h 06 GMT+02:00 INFO Published AuthServer IOR on port 7609"
     or in short form german:
        "29.04.00 19:07 INFO Published AuthServer IOR on port 7609"
     or minimal:
        "Published AuthServer IOR on port 7609"
     See xmlBlaster.properties.template how to use it.

   - Bugfix when logging to file with missing permissions in Util.java
     The bug resulted in a never ending loop.

   - xmlBlaster.properties can now be placed in 'java.home' directory
     as well (this is for example /opt/jdk1.2.2/jre/lib).
     This feature may be helpful if you want to start a deamon
     or a servlet which has no home directory.
     See org.xmlBlaster.util.Property for more informations

   - xmlBlaster now uses the new JacORB 1.1 with SSL support

   - .jacorb_properties is renamed to jacorb.properties
     YOU NEED TO REMOVE YOUR $HOME/.jacorb_properties and
     configure $HOME/jacorb.properties
     Use the xmlBlaster/jacorb.properties.template as a base

   - Peter added the sweet rainbow fish to our control panel

   - Enhancements with browser callback framework

   - XmlKey.getContentMimeExtended() now returns "" (empty string)
     as default fallback. Before the default was null.
     This is smarter when used in XSL style sheets.

Changes for 0.75 [Mar.28, 2000]
===============================

   - Konrad completed the fabulous Browser callback framework!
     And it works incredible well.
     Browsers get instant callback updates from xmlBlaster messages
     through a persistent http connection.
     It supports many feature like browser pinging, slow
     browser queuing etc.
     Konrad will write a little tutorial in the next week.
     See xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/protocol/http
     See xmlBlaster/doc/http/BlasterHttpProxy.gif

   - Added little tool which allows to subscribe
     from command line for a message (for testing/debugging).
     See xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/client/reader/README

   - Added two internal messages with key oid="__sys__Login"
     and key oid="__sys__Logout"
     You may subscribe on those messages if you want to be informed
     about other client which login or logout

   - Added a xmlBlaster reference handbook to xmlBlaster.org
     This page is generated from the requirement XML files in the
     xmlBlaster/doc/requirements directory of the distribution.
     It is available on our homepage in the 'Doc' section.

   - Bugfix if the Callback of a PtP receiver is disappeared,
     this usually happens when the receiver crashes without a logout.
     Now the XmlBlasterException with e.id="CallbackFailed" is thrown
     to the sender,  and the message is queued for the receiver
     if the qos flag <ForceQueuing> was set.

   - Allow clients to ping xmlBlaster, to test reliable the connection.
     The xmlBlaster.idl was extended with a ping() method.
     Java clients may use CorbaConnection.java to automatically test
     ping the connection.

   - Added <qos> tag <subscriptionId> for update messages.
     This allows the client to find out which of his subscriptions
     caused this update.

   - Added <qos> tag <state> for update messages.
     This is not finished, it always shows OK for the moment.

   - Command line parameters (args) and xmlBlaster.property file entries are
     merged. The 'args' overwrite the property file variables.
     Every xmlBlaster.property variable may as well be specified on
     command line. The leading "-" or "+" from the command line key is
     stripped before it is merged into the properties hash table.
     For example, the "-iorFile" command line argument corresponds to the
     "iorFile" variable in the xmlBlaster.properties file.
     See Property.java


Changes for 0.74 [Feb.29, 2000]
==============================
   - New XML based requirements framework.
     See xmlBlaster/doc/requirements

   - 'Fail save' client connection for Java clients added.
     Clients begin polling and automatic local recording of messages
     if xmlBlaster server disappears.
     See CorbaConnection.java

   - C++ POA demo client added [Michele]
     See xmlBlaster/testsuite/c++

   - Recorder to record/playback of messages in slow/fast motion added.
     See InvocationRecorder.java

   - CorbaConnection: logout(boolean) deprecated -> use logout() now.

   - Changed xmlBlaster.idl: messageUnit    -> msgUnit
                             messageUnitArr -> msgUnitArr
     Case does not matter, IDL is case-insensitive when detecting name clashes.
     (Thanks to Michele Laghi)

   - Added a guide line for xmlBLaster core developer.
     See xmlBlaster/doc/developer-guidelines.html

   - Set up xmlBLaster to use Ant as it's build system [James]

   - Added the revolutionary XML based JDBC database gateway. [James]
     see xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/protocol/jdbc
     see xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/jdbc

   - Added servlet - browser callback framework (not yet finished)
     see xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/protocol/http


Changes for 0.73 [Feb.20, 2000]
==============================
   - Use the -P option to check out, so old directories won't show up any more:
     cvs checkout -P xmlBlaster
   
   - Migrated to JacORB 1.0 beta 15

   - Reorganized package structure
     org.xmlBlaster.authenticateIdl  -> org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.authenticateIdl
     org.xmlBlaster.serverIdl        -> org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.serverIdl
     org.xmlBlaster.clientIdl        -> org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.clientIdl
     org.xmlBlaster.client.filestore -> org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.client.feeder
     org.xmlBlaster.engine.xml2java  -> new added

   - Improved client / server connection negotiation (IOR bootstrapping)

   - Introduced DocBook schema
     Documentation is written in xml, and converted
     to html/pdf etc. with XSL style sheets.
     See example in xmlBlaster/doc/whitepaper/README

   - Further minor changes (see cvs log or cvsweb if you really want to know it)


Changes for 0.72 [Feb.1, 2000]
==============================

   - Support for new QoS tag <ForceQueuing /> in PtP style.
     * Without this flag, a message published to a client which is not
       logged in throws an exception.
     * Using this flag, the message will be queued by xmlBlaster
       until the client logs in. On login, all queued messages
       are sent to the client immediately.

   - Added some simple console input mode, to control xmlBlaster
     Type <?> and <Enter> when xmlBlaster is running to get help.

   - Extended control panel GUI to support
     * dumping of xmlBlaster internal state
     * clearing the logging window
     * toggle from control panel GUI to console mode and back again

   - Bug fixed for subscribe with oid and later publish of this message.
     The BigXmlDom was not updated properly.

   - Added support for <qos><Readonly /></qos>,
     where only the first publish is accepted.

   - Added logging redirection to file,
     use on command line "-?" to query possible parameters.

   - Bug fixed for multiple login (without logout) and PtP messages.

   - Bug fixed for multiple <isDurable> messages.

   - Added missing FileDriver.erase().

   - Two bug fixes with unSubscribe() calls for previous XPATH subscriptions.

==============================

   - Added the incredible MOM slide show, see http://www.xmlBlaster.org

   - Added SubscribeKeyWrapper.java SubscribeQosWrapper.java as client helper
     to help to hide raw XML ASCII strings

   - Added simple persistent store (file based)
     Needs to be configured in $HOME/xmlBlaster.properties

   - Added a xmlBlaster.properties file (should be placed into $HOME).
     see xmlBlaster/xmlBlaster.properties.template as a base to start with

   - Renamed file names from ...QoS... to ...Qos...

   - Added a file feeder PublishFile.java (publishes files as message to xmlBlaster)

   - Added some help to xmlBlaster/doc/programming-guide.lyx (still ugly)
