   <topic>XmlBlaster provides a replication mechanism following the master/slave ticket paradigm</topic>
   <description>
      If multiple xmlBlaster servers are running, every message is assigned to exactly one
      master server. The different xmlBlaster servers login to each other like other clients
      and act as slave to messages which they are not master from.
      This login is done in 'lazy' mode. As soon as a client requests a message
      for which the local server is not master, this server does a login to the master
      and subscribes the message from there. The message is than cached locally and further
      local requests from clients are handled locally.
      An adjustable expire date clears the cached message.
      If a message is published from a data source to a slave server, the message is routed directly
      to the master server. If the master server is currently offline, it is queued
      for this 'client' until it logs in.
