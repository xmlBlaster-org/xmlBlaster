   <topic>XmlBlaster provides a plugin possibility for its persistence layer</topic>
   <description>
      To store messages from xmlBlaster and to restore them again after a new
      startup of the server there is a lightweight interface, called I_PersitenceDriver,
      available.
      You may supply your own persistence layer, which for example stores
      the messages in a database like Oracle, PostgreSQL or Ozone, or wherever
      you like.

      Currently we only provide a very simple file based store, called FileDriver,
      which may be used as a reference implementation to your own persistency.

      Writing an own persistence layer is very easy:

      1. Implement the I_PersitenceDriver interface (look into FileDriver
      how you could do it).

      2. Register the driver with xmlBlaster through the xmlBlaster.properties
      file with the Persistence.* variables.

      Note that this interface is very likely to change in one of the next
      xmlBlaster releases, since it is to simple too support caching.
