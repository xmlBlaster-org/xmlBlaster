   <topic>XmlBlaster provides a plugin possibility for its persistence layer</topic>
   <description>
      <p>
      To store messages from xmlBlaster and to restore them again after a new
      startup of the server there is a lightweight interface, called I_PersitenceDriver,
      available.
      </p>
      <p>
      You may supply your own persistence layer, which for example stores
      the messages in a database like Oracle, PostgreSQL or Ozone, or wherever
      you like.
      </p>

      <p>
      Currently we only provide a very simple file based store, called FileDriver,
      which may be used as a reference implementation to your own persistency.
      </p>

      <p>
      Writing an own persistence layer is very easy:
      <br />
      1. Implement the I_PersitenceDriver interface (look into FileDriver
      how you could do it).
      <br />
      2. Register the driver with xmlBlaster through the xmlBlaster.properties
      file with the Persistence.* variables.
      </p>

      <p>
      Note that this interface is very likely to change in one of the next
      xmlBlaster releases, since it is too simple (no caching support).
