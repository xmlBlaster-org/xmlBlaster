   <topic>Point to point (PtP) routing of messages in a cluster environment</topic>
   <description>
      <p>
      In this requirement we examine how a client can send messages to other
      clients (or specific sessions of other clients) in PtP mode in an xmlBlaster cluster environment.
      </p>
      <p>
      Probably it is best to read the cluster requirement first to get a basic understanding
      what a xmlBaster cluster setup is (see link below).
      </p>
      <p>
      PtP messages in a cluster environment is mainly a routing problem.
      The problem to solve is to find a unique naming schema and with this how to find the destination cluster node.
      </p>
      <p>
      The following figure shows the unified session naming conventions.

      <p>
      The <i>absolute name</i> is cluster wide unique. Sending a PtP message with such a destination name
      allows us to route the message in a cluster environment.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you destination address has an absolute name like '/node/heron/client/joe'
      the local node and all direct neighbors are checked and if 'heron' is found the message is
      directly delivered. Otherwise the same routing rule as for Publish/Subscribe apply.
      For example a relative destination address 'client/joe/1' is routed similar
      to Publish/Subscribe by looking at the key-domain or other key attributes.
      If no routing matches the local node is chosen and the PtP message
      is queued for 'client/joe/1' until this client logs in.
      </p>

   <pre>
&lt;qos>
  &lt;destination forceQueuing='true'>
     /node/heron/client/joeConnectedToHeron/-9
  &lt;/destination>
&lt;/qos>
   </pre>
