   <topic>Point to point (PtP) routing of messages in a cluster environment</topic>
   <description>
      <p>
      In this requirement we examine how a client can send messages to other
      clients (or specific sessions of other clients) in PtP mode in an xmlBlaster cluster environment.
      </p>
      <p>
      Probably it is best to read the cluster requirement first to get a basic understanding
      what a xmlBaster cluster setup is (see link below).
      </p>
      <p>
      PtP messages in a cluster environment is mainly a routing problem.
      The problem to solve is to find a unique naming schema and with this how to find the destination cluster node.
      </p>
      <p>
      The following figure shows the unified session naming conventions.

      <br />
      <p>
      The <i>absolute name</i> is cluster wide unique. Sending a PtP message with such a destination name
      allows us to route the message in a cluster environment.
      </p>
      <p>
      The current implementation supports only destinations where the destination cluster node
      is directly connected to the source cluster node - or if a cluster node has only one known further cluster
      node the message is routed as well through such a chain of clusters.
      In a future release we can add a plugin based node lookup to allow extended routing if demand
      for such a feature arises.
