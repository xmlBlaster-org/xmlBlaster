      <strong>This is a collection of thoughts about MOM Transactions from our mailing list</strong>

      <p />
      General transaction ability of xmlBlaster
      <ul>
         <li>2 phase commit</li>
         <li>long transactions</li>
         <li>commit, rollback, recovery etc mechanisms</li>
         <li>nested transactions (to complicated to use for everyday problems?)</li>
      </ul>
 
      XA-Support

      How to become an XA-ResourceManager?
      <br />
      Find several transaction monitors/managers with XA-Support to test with.
  
      <p />
      OTS-support<br />
      How to become a transactional object?

      <p />
      Compare transaction functionality with other MOM
      <ul>
         <li>Transactional queues (IBM's MQSeries, BEA's MessageQ)</li>
         <li>Transactional publish and subscribe (Tuxedos EventBroker)</li>
         <li>Transactional Conversations</li>
      </ul>

      <p />
      Perhaps we should implement a little TP-Monitor
      to test our implementation (in fact we need a tool
      to load balance multiple xmlBlaster servers).

      <p />
      MOM transactions span across companies or the internet.
      So we need to be controllable by external TP monitors.

      <p />
      Maybe MOM will loosely couple together flat transactions from different
      locations by providing the durable queue part 'D' of the 'ACID'.
