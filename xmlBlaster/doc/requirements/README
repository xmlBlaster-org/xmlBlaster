XmlBlaster requirements
=======================

The requirement document layout is described in requirement.dtd

Each requirement is described in an own xml file

Requirements have no numbers but a unique describing name,
the filename is the same as the <requirement id=""> ID.

Every requirement needs a <fix> tag, which refers to the testsuite
with one to many full automatic test cases.

Every bug is noted here and checked with a testsuite case.

You can query a closed requirement as follows:
   java DomQueryTest  engine.get.no.xml  "requirement/fix[@status='CLOSED']/.."
