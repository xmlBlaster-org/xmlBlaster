   <topic>XmlBlaster provides a simple file based persistence layer to store messages marked with &lt;isDurable/></topic>
   <description>
      To store messages and to restore them again after a new
      startup of the xmlBlaster server there is a lightweight interface,
      called I_PersitenceDriver, available. As a reference implementation
      We provide a very simple file based store, called FileDriver,
      which may be used as a reference implementation to your own persistency.
      Please remind, that the FileDriver implementation is only a simple
      demo, it is based on your filesystem. So don't try to store more then
      some thousands messages with this layer!

      If you really want to use this driver for more than some hundred different messages
      we recommend to use it with the ReiserFS.

      Reiserfs is a file system using a plug-in based object oriented variant on classical balanced tree algorithms.
      See the <a href="http://www.reiserfs.org/">ReiserFS homepage</a>
      Only messages which are marked as &lt;isDurable&gt; are stored using this persistent
      layer.
