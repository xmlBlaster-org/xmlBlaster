      You can publish messages by putting files on a certain location in the file system.
   </topic>

   <description>
      This is a native plugin which is listening on a certain directory in the file system. 
      It detects by polling on the directory if a new file has arrived. Once the plugin assumes it has
      completely written, it will read its contents and publish them.
      
      <ul>
         <li>The Poller is running as a native xmlBlaster plugin</li>
         <li>Every registered Poller is listening on exactly one single directory</li>
         <li>The polling interval is expressed in ms and is configurable</li>
         <li>All files in a directory on which a Poller instance is listening, are published on 
             a single configurable topic.</li>
         <li>It is possible to specify a filter for the file name, then only the files matching the filter
             will be processed by the current plugin instance. 
         </li>
         <li>It is possible to have several plugins polling for the same directory provided they all have
             a filter specified. The choice of the filters must be such to avoid that the same file will 
             match more than one filter. If the user does not ensure that, unpredicted behavior will result. 
         </li>

         <li>After a successful publish of the content of a file, the file is removed from the file system.
              Alternatively, if a 'sent' directory is specified in the configuration, processed
              files will be moved to that destination. If for some reason it is not possible to 
              move the file to that direction (for example if necessary rights are missing), then the
              plugin will continue to poll but will not process any file anymore until the problem has
              been manually removed.
         </li>
         <li>It is possible to configure a maximum file size. Files bigger than the specified size are not
             published. If a 'discarded' directory is specified in the properties, then the file will be 
             moved to that directory, otherwise it will be deleted.
         </li>
         <li>
            When moving files, wether to the 'sent' or 'discarded' directories, if a file with the same
            relative name already exists, it is overwritten.
         </li>
         <li>
            Detection of 'file ready for publishing': 
            <p>
            If <i>lockExtention</i> is specified in the plugin configuration, then publishing of a file is
            controlled by a <i>lock</i> file. 
            This means that if you specified <i>*.lck</i> as the <i>lockExtention</i>, and want to publish
            a file called <i>someFile.gif</i>, then the publishing of the file will be inhibited until a 
            file <i>someFile.gif.lck</i> will be present in the directory.
            </p>
            <p>
            The plugin will wait <i>delaySinceLastFileChange</i> milliseconds since 
            the last modification of the file to be published (date and size are checked) before 
            processing anyway. This way, by choosing a sufficiently long <i>delaySinceLastFileChange</i>
            it is possible to work in an <i>optimistic</i> way without any lock file. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Note however that this <i>optimistic</i> publishing is not to 100% safe. Suppose the writing of
            the file to be published is stalled for a time which is longer than what specified in
            <i>delaySinceLastFileChange</i>, then the file will be published in its incomplete state.
            </p>        
         </li>
         <li>
           If permissions to read the directory are missing or xmlBlaster has no read rights on a 
           specific file, or if an IO exception occurs when reading a file or trying to delete or move
           a file, an error is reported (logged) and the plugin does temporarly stop working.
           (to ensure correct sequence). The plugin continues however to poll and when the rights are 
           manually fixed, it continues working again.
         </li>
         <li>
           To be able to track the message origin, filename and date are sent in the client properties as:
           <ul>
              <li><i>_fileName</i></li> (the relative file name as a String)
              <li><i>_fileDate</i></li> (the timestamp of the file in ms as a long)
           </ul>
         </li>
	 <li>
	   To listen to different directories and/or to publish on different topics you need to configure different
	   plugins. When doing so assign to each plugin a different id (this is actually a general requirement for the
	   plugins).
	 </li>
       </ul>

         <td><b>optional</b>: This is the time expressed in milliseconds which the plugin will wait
         before publishing a file after its latest detected change. The plugin detects changes on
         discrete times (every time it polls), so the acurancy is never better than what specified in
         <i>pollInterval</i>. A file is considered to have changed either if its size has changed or 
         its date. The plugin always waits what specified here even when using a lock file. So if you 
         always control your publishes with a locking file you can set this attribute to zero to
         avoid delay.
