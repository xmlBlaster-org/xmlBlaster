   <a NAME="need"></a><h3>Why should I need such a middleware?</h3>
      <font size=-1>
      If you have a distributed client / server architecture
      you will face the problem how all the processes communicate with each other.
      xmlBlaster provides a professional way for sending instant messages between
      C/C++, Perl, Tcl, Java and any other CORBA aware programming language based
      process.<br />
      Message routing may be based on the publish/subscribe paradigm where sender doesn't
      know the receivers or on direct addressing allowing broadcasts to receivers which are
      selected by there names or by XPath queries over receiver meta informations like
      receiver roles or receiver groups or any other XML based meta information.
      </font>
   <p /><br /><br />

   <a NAME="CORBA-XML"></a><h3>Why CORBA and XML, is it only a hype?</h3>
      <font size=-1>
      Yes, its a hype, but a nice one.<br />
      CORBA allows inter operability between all major programming languages with
      type safety at compile time.<br />
      XML allows dynamic modeling of real day problem domains with type safety at runtime.<br />
      The query languages XPath and XQL allow to access XML in a powerful new way.
      </font>
   <p /><br /><br />

   <a NAME="License"></a><h3>Why is it open source?</h3>
      <font size=-1>
      We use a lot of open source products in daily life, for example gcc and Linux.<br />
      So we had the desire to contribute something back to the community.<br />
      The license is based on LGPL (see LICENSE file), with some restrictions concerning aspects of humanity.<br />
      Please note that the code is delivered as is, there are no warranties.<br />
      </font>
   <p /><br /><br />

   <a NAME="lang"></a><h3>Are there examples how to access xmlBlaster with Java, C/C++, Perl, TCL?</h3>
      <font size=-1>
      Yes, there are examples provided in the directory <code>xmlBlaster/testsuite</code><br />
      You can try the examples with xmlBlaster and if you like it, use the examples as a base for your own applications.<br />
      If you are using xmlBlaster with other languages, it would be nice if you could send
      us a little note with some working code.<br />
      </font>
   <p /><br /><br />

   <a NAME="state"></a><h3>What is the current state of xmlBlaster, can I use it in my project?</h3>
      <font size=-1>
      Yes, you can use it on your project.<br />
      xmlBlaster is quite new, but the basic features are implemented and the development is very active and alive.<br />
      We develop daily on xmlBlaster, since it is used in two commercial applications in the moment.<br />
      So, xmlBlaster is even getting better with every day.<br />
      Note that there is no transaction support yet.
      </font>
   <p /><br /><br />

   <a NAME="db"></a><h3>Is there any database used in xmlBlaster?</h3>
      <font size=-1>
      In the current version of xmlBlaster there is no persistent store available.<br />
      But we are working hard to find or develop some suitable open source XML database to integrate
      as our internal persistence and caching engine.<br />
      For the moment, if you need a persistence layer, you should write a little xmlBlaster
      client in your favorite language, which subscribes to all messages which need persistence and
      saves them on the file system or in your favorite database.<br />
      Any ideas are welcome!
      </font>
   <p /><br /><br />

   <a NAME="XML"></a><h3>What is XML'ish with xmlBlaster?</h3>
      <font size=-1>
      All messages sent using xmlBlaster have a header, a content and a QoS.<br />
      <ul>
         <li>
            HEADER - The message meta data<br />
            The header is XML based, so you are able to place your meta data
            of the message content here.<br />
            Your are able to query this meta data with XPath, the XML query language.
            <br />
         </li>
         <li>
            CONTENT - the data BLOB<br />
            The message content is a BLOB (binary data, or an 'octet sequence' in CORBA jargon).<br />
            So you may send JPEG, ASCII, XML, serialized code or whatever with your messages.<br />
            You can't query the content, but we will provide a plugin possibility in a future
            release, with a XML-XPath plugin as an example.<br />
            This will allow full text searches.
            <br />
         </li>
         <li>
            QoS - the Quality of Service<br />
            The Quality of Service are XML based informations to control the xmlBlaster.<br />
            For example you may specify specify some expiration date or transaction context or
            whatever the xmlBlaster is supporting.
            <br />
         </li>
      </ul>
      </font>
   <p /><br /><br />

   <a NAME="JMS"></a><h3>Why is it not 100% JMS (Java Message Service) based?</h3>
      <font size=-1>
      JMS has several drawback, the main problems with JMS are:
      <ul>
         <li>
            JMS is not CORBA based.<br />
            Trying to access JMS from Perl, Tcl, C/C++ or any other CORBA aware language
            will give you some major headache.<br />
            But the world is and will ever be heterogeneous, so there is no place for narrow minded
            Java centric approaches.
         </li>
         <li>
            JMS is not XML based.<br />
            XML allows professional modeling of every day problems with free modification at runtime.<br />
            So basing a middleware on the XML descriptive possibilities and allowing the query
            with a XML query language is a major advantage over key-value based approaches.
         </li>
         <li>
            JMS API is split.<br />
            xmlBlaster has only very few communication methods to allow the whole spectrum
            of MOM (Message orientated middleware) communication paradigms.<br />
            Extending the xmlBlaster CORBA API once it is published as release 1.0 is very
            unlike.<br />
            Adding new MOM features in future releases of xmlBlaster is mainly adding backward compatible
            XML tags.<br />
         </li>
         <li>
            JMS API is an API specification and no implementation.<br />
            The reference implementation JMQ of JMS is no open source :-)
         </li>
      </ul>
      Inter operability between xmlBlaster and JMS will be evaluated in future xmlBlaster releases.

   <a NAME="COM"></a><h3>Why is it not COM/DCOM/COM+ based?</h3>
      <font size=-1>
      What is COM ??   :-O<br />
      </font>
   <p /><br /><br />

   <a NAME="os"></a><h3>Which platforms are supported?</h3>
      <font size=-1>
      Every platform supporting JDK 1.2 or better should be OK for the server to run.<br />
      On the client side, you only need a running CORBA library to access xmlBlaster.<br />
      To develop xmlBlaster, you need a UNIX box, or some OS which supports GNU make.<br />
      </font>
   <p /><br /><br />

   <a NAME="contribute"></a><h3>How can I contribute?</h3>
      <font size=-1>
      This is a great idea, fields of interest are distributed transactions, persistence, load balancing<br />
      and anything else you can imagine.<br />
      Fell free to contribute ideas, code, links or patches on our mailing list.<br />
      If you want to contribute code contact us to get cvs write access.
