1) start a tomcat  (to have the applet proxy running)

2) build the servlet (the applet proxy). It will install itself into tomcat:

build  -DTOMCAT_HOME=/home/michele/jakarta/jakarta-tomcat deploy_war

3) start an xmlBlaster instance (keep 8080 clear for tomcat):

java org.xmlBlaster.Main -plugin/xmlrpc/port 8089

4) start the publisher:

java http.dhtml.systemInfo.SystemInfoPublisher


5) Download the j2me wireless toolkit 2.1 (you will find it at the url
http://java.sun.com/products/j2mewtoolkit/download-2_1.html)

6) install it in let's say ${J2ME_HOME} then

7) build the embedded application:
   build -DJ2ME_HOME=${J2ME_HOME} j2me
this will create a SystemInfo.jar file in ${XMLBLASTER_HOME}/demo/j2me
don't forget to update the size of the jar file in the SystemInfo.jad file
which resides in the same directory

8) Add ${J2ME_HOME}/bin to the path (on bash: export PATH=$PATH:${J2ME_HOME}

8) and start the emulator and a cellular phone will pop up in your screen:

emulator -Xdescriptor:${XMLBLASTER_HOME}/demo/j2me/SystemInfo.jad

Start to play with the xmlBlaster client.


Additional Notes:
in the SystemInfo.jad file there is a property called 'serlvetUrl'. You 
can change that to point to the address where your servlet resides. Per
default it points to the xmlBlaster server. If you omit it, it will point
to the localhost.
