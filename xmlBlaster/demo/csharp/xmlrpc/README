	CSharp (C#) Access to XmlBlaster using XML-RPC Protocol

Note:

	All compiled stuff (exe and lib) are for windows.
	I hope one day someone will add C# compiled stuff for other platforms.

Folders :

	./bin : the executable demo
		it was compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio .Net 2003 on Windows XP.
	./lib : the xml-rpc library for C# from http://www.xml-rpc.net/
	./src : sources files for demos (C# and graphics).
	./VisualStudioNet2003 : projects files

Running the demo :

	Start XmlBlaster

   > set XMLBLASTER_HOME=D:\xmlBlaster_REL_1_0_7\xmlBlaster
   > java -cp %XMLBLASTER_HOME%/lib -jar %XMLBLASTER_HOME%/lib/xmlBlaster.jar

	Start two CSharpDrawingDemo.exe
	Set the right server url in both and one different username in each instance.
	Click connect button on both, then start drawing.
