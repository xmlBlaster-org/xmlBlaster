Here is a little demo to user Macromedia Flash Player to access xmlBlaster.

1. Requirement for running that demo :

	- the folder's demo must be accessible with a web browser
	- the url must pointing at the same IP or DomainName than XmlBlaster server.
	- A running xmlBlaster server with the xml-rpc plugin activated

1.a MM Flash Player security constraint

	Flash Player use a sandbox mechanism to protect the user's computer.
	So a Flash applet can only make network access on the same IP or Domain Name than its url.

	There are some mechanism that allow to change that policy,
	but in the state of my knowledgs, I could not explain them ;o{
	note : perhaps around a file named crossdomain.xml

1.b XML-RPC protocol

	to enable XML-RPC at xmlBlaster server side check the file
		XMLBLASTER_HOME/xmlBlaster.properties
	for the line
		CbProtocolPlugin[XMLRPC][1.0]=org.xmlBlaster.protocol.xmlrpc.CallbackXmlRpcDriver
	and in
		XMLBLASTER_HOME/xmlBlasterPlugins.xml
	for the block
	   <!-- ProtocolPlugin[XMLRPC][1.0]=org.xmlBlaster.protocol.xmlrpc.XmlRpcDriver -->
	   <plugin id='XMLRPC' className='org.xmlBlaster.protocol.xmlrpc.XmlRpcDriver'>
	      <action do='LOAD' onStartupRunlevel='3' sequence='4'/> 
	      <action do='STOP' onShutdownRunlevel='2' sequence='3'/>   
	   </plugin>

	For the client side, I've used the library
		xmlrpcflash : XMLRPC for ActionScript 2.0 from http://xmlrpcflash.sf.net
	More details in demo's folder XMLRPC

1.c Deployement of the Applet

	To make the Flash Applet accessible on a webserver on the same IP or Domain Name than the xmlBlaster server,
	you can follow instruction found at XMLBLASTER_HOME/demo/http/README.

	That process was to complex for my little brain,
	so I've just lauched a little webserver (ZazouMiniWebServer) on the computer where xmlBlaster was running.
	Then put the Applet in the document root, and call it with Firefox.

2. Details of the demo

	xmlBlaster-perf.swf
		The Flash Applet to run in a web browser.
		I've choose to compile the swf in Flash 7 format.
	xmlBlaster-perf.fla
		The source code of the applet.
		It was developped with MM Flash Pro 8.
	Base64.as
		A ActionScript library for Encode/Decode in Base64 format.
		Found at http://blog.jasonnussbaum.com/?p=108
	XMLRPC
		The folder of the xmlrpcflash library
		Found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmlrpcflash

	I've made some changes (corrections) in xmlrpcflash. They are indexed in the _README.txt file.

3. Futur plan

3.a completing the demo

	- add more doc about possible deployement of the Flash Applet, like in file xmlBlaster/demo/http/README
	- add a xmlBlaster.update test
	- add some processing of received data, for the moment only success/error are checked, and of course the sessionID is decoded to.

3.b What about callback and realtime update ???

	Pooling for new message is ugly. It should be nice and economic to be wake up on new messages.
	I've some ideas to explore :

	Perhaps trying to implement the xmlBlaster SOCKET protocol ... with the XMLSocket AS2 object
	to get a persistent a bi-directionnal communication channel.
