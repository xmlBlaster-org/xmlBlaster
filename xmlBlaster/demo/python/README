Howto start the demo:

 - start xmlBlaster
      java -jar lib/xmlBlaster.jar

 - run the Python demo client
      python hello.py

Thats it!

Fredrik Lundh has provided an excellent XML-RPC library for Python.
   http://www.pythonware.com/products/xmlrpc/

To install, download the latest version. You can either stick the *.py files in the same directory as your Python code, or you can install
them in your system's Python directory.

RedHat 6.2 users can type the following:

    $ mkdir xmlrpclib-0.9.8
    $ cd xmlrpclib-0.9.8
    $ unzip ../xmlrpc-0.9.8-990621.zip
    $ python
    >>> import xmlrpclib
    >>> import xmlrpcserver
    >>> Control-D
    $ su -c 'cp *.py *.pyc /usr/lib/python1.5/'

We import two of the *.py files to trick Python into compiling them. Users of other platforms should consult their Python
documentation.

For more Python examples, see the article XML-RPC: It Works Both Ways on the O'Reilly Network.

RE: [XmlRpc-Java] Is possible to generate an XML-RPC request with an HTML form?

Well I just got this exact test working. Here's mine:

<HTML>
<BODY>

<FORM ACTION="http://xxx.xxx.x.x/cgi-bin/jofa.exe" METHOD="POST">

<TEXTAREA name="CODE" rows="30" cols="120">

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<methodCall>
[...]
</methodResponse>

</TEXTAREA>

<BR>
<INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="GO">

</FORM>

</BODY>
</HTML>

The nice thing about this method is that you can simply paste in any
XML
code into the middle if you don't like what's there when it starts up.
Works
fine, but I've found what I think is a bug in helma - lots of lf's and
whitespace seems to make the parser die (at least it did for me once
the
length got up to about 50 lines).
