Fredrik Lundh has provided an excellent XML-RPC library for Python.
   http://www.pythonware.com/products/xmlrpc/

To install, download the latest version. You can either stick the *.py files in the same directory as your Python code, or you can install
them in your system's Python directory.

RedHat 6.2 users can type the following:

    $ mkdir xmlrpclib-0.9.8
    $ cd xmlrpclib-0.9.8
    $ unzip ../xmlrpc-0.9.8-990621.zip
    $ python
    >>> import xmlrpclib
    >>> import xmlrpcserver
    >>> Control-D
    $ su -c 'cp *.py *.pyc /usr/lib/python1.5/'

We import two of the *.py files to trick Python into compiling them. Users of other platforms should consult their Python
documentation.

For more Python examples, see the article XML-RPC: It Works Both Ways on the O'Reilly Network.
