Well I just got this exact test working. Here's mine:

<HTML>
<BODY>

<FORM ACTION="http://xxx.xxx.x.x/cgi-bin/jofa.exe" METHOD="POST">

<TEXTAREA name="CODE" rows="30" cols="120">

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<methodCall>
[...]
</methodResponse>

</TEXTAREA>

<BR>
<INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="GO">

</FORM>

</BODY>
</HTML>

The nice thing about this method is that you can simply paste in any
XML
code into the middle if you don't like what's there when it starts up.
Works
fine, but I've found what I think is a bug in helma - lots of lf's and
whitespace seems to make the parser die (at least it did for me once
the
length got up to about 50 lines).
