
Here is a little demo to use PHP langage to access xmlBlaster.

At least, you need a xmlBlaster server running somewhere

        - Start xmlBlaster
        $ cd xmlBlaster
        $ java -jar lib/xmlBlaster.jar

Then,

        - On the same computer, or on another one, you'll need a http server with PHP langage activated.
        - copy php/xmlrpc demo files into a folder,
        - call http://your.httpd.server/the.php.folder.demo/index.php
        - fill some fields, Server, usually machine_name.domain_name,
          Port, 8080, User and Password, Using the default config/xmlBlaster.htpasswd file
          guest & secret (Make sure xmlBlaster is configured to use the htpasswd file).
        - click "connect" button ...
        - Enter an XPATH Query such as //key once you are logged in.
          Some example XPATH Queries...
          //key[starts-with(@oid, '__sys__UserList')]
          //key[starts-with(@oid, '__sys__Login')]
          //key[starts-with(@oid, '__sys__Logout')]
                
nice & easy, isn't it ?
