NOTE: This demo is currently not supported !
See ../README for XML-RPC demonstration.



To run this demo do the following:


- Make sure to have the following set in your $HOME/xmlBlaster.properties file:

    Protocol.Drivers=......, XML-RPC:org.xmlBlaster.protocol.xmlrpc.XmlRpcDriver, ....
    Protocol.CallbackDrivers=..., XML-RPC:org.xmlBlaster.protocol.xmlrpc.CallbackXmlRpcDriver, ....

  This loads XmlRpc support into xmlBlaster.


- Start xmlBlaster:

  ${JAVA_WRAP} org.xmlBlaster.MainGUI

     or

  ${JAVA_WRAP} org.xmlBlaster.Main


- Start the xml-rpc client from this directory

  java javaclients.xmlrpc.XmlRpcHttpClient < demo.xml

NOTE: The client sends the data from demo.xml
      and performs some other tests.


NOTE: There is a helper class in src/java/org/xmlBlaster/client/protocol/xmlrpc
      called XmlBlasterProxy.java which clients can use.
      It wraps the 'low level' xml-rpc invocation

NOTE: https should work as well (see xmlrpc mailing list):
    You may install SUN JSSE (or used another product, because this one is only a proof of
    concept)
    and execute the following lines before using the helma.xmlrpc.XmlRpcClient.
    These system properties can also be set on the command line,
    without having to modify your application
    (the requiered jar files must have been added to your classpath, refer to the product
    installation)

      System.setProperty("java.protocol.handler.pkgs",
      "com.sun.net.ssl.internal.www.protocol");
      System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStore",         pathToMyKeyStore);
      System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword", myKeyStorePassword);


enjoy it !
