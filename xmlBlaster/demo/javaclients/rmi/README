How to use RMI to access xmlBlaster
-----------------------------------

You can use any of our Java demos to talk to xmlBlaster over RMI
just by specifing 

  -protocol RMI

on the command line. Or even switch the default protocol to RMI
with this entry in xmlBlaster.properties

   client.protocol=RMI

The recommended way is to use I_XmlBlasterAccess as in the
demo clients in the directory above, which allows switching
of the access protocol between CORBA, XmlRpc and RMI.

This demo shows you a raw, low level RMI access to xmlBlaster.
And this is how to try it:

Add the driver to xmlBlaster.properties, this example starts
the CORBA and the RMI server (the driver is activated by default):

   ProtocolPlugin[RMI][1.0]=org.xmlBlaster.protocol.rmi.RmiDriver
   CbProtocolPlugin[RMI][1.0]=org.xmlBlaster.protocol.rmi.CallbackRmiDriver

Adjust the security policy file if you like to (it is currently totaly relaxed):

   xmlBlaster/config/xmlBlaster.policy

Start the server:

   java -Djava.security.policy=${XMLBLASTER_HOME}/config/xmlBlaster.policy org.xmlBlaster.Main

And the demo client:

   java -Djava.security.policy=${XMLBLASTER_HOME}/config/xmlBlaster.policy  javaclients.rmi.ClientGet


If you ommit the "-Djava.security.policy=..." a relaxed xmlBlaster.policy is accessed
through the CLASSPATH.
