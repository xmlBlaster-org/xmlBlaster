1) start an xmlBlaster instance:
java org.xmlBlaster.Main

2) in another terminal start the demo:
javaclients.graphical.GraphicChat -publishDelay 100

3) in another terminal start a second instance of the demo:
javaclients.graphical.GraphicChat -publishDelay 100

In both instances choose "new" in the "file" menu. Alternatively you 
choose 
  a) "new" in one instance and (the sequence is important) 
  b) "open" in the other (but only if you have a stored drawing already).

if you want the drawings to update slower (100 ms is default) then you change
the "publishDelay" flag on the command line.

NOTE: It is a simple demo and as such it is quite limited and not for production
level. Please feel free to improve it.
