This is a pretty basic kind of chat-application but worth a try.     
                                                                  
Compile it (make all) and start it like that:                     
                                                                  
   jaco javaclients.chat.SimpleChat -name "Nickname"              
                                                                  
where "Nickname" should be different for each client you start.   
Don´t forget to start the server (jaco org.xmlBlaster.MainGUI) first.
