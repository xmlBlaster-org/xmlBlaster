This is a pretty basic kind of CORBA based chat-application but worth a try.

If you want to have generated speech for arriving messages
copy config/speed.properties to your home directory (only with JDK 1.4 or better).

Compile it (make all) and start it like that:

   java javaclients.chat.SimpleChat -session.name "Nickname"

where "Nickname" should be different for each client you start.
Don´t forget to start the server (java org.xmlBlaster.MainGUI) first.

To chat from you multi homed host the another server running xmlBlaster (CORBA):

   java javaclients.chat.SimpleChat -session.name Ben -bootstrapHostname 62.132.140.7 -dispatch/callback/plugin/ior/hostname 198.197.24.129 

   -bootstrapHostname is the xmlBlaster server,
   -dispatch/callback/plugin/ior/hostname is the IP address for our internal chat CORBA callback server.

   Note that if you use a dialin host with dynamic IP the correct
   IP is usually extracted and choosen automatically by I_XmlBlasterAccess.


To chat from you multi homed host the another server running xmlBlaster (XMLRPC):

   java javaclients.chat.SimpleChat -session.name Tim/1 -protocol XMLRPC -dispatch/callback/plugin/xmlrpc/hostname 198.197.24.129 -dispatch/connection/plugin/xmlrpc/hostname 62.132.140.7


To chat from you multi homed host the another server running xmlBlaster (RMI):

   java javaclients.chat.SimpleChat -session.name RMI -protocol RMI -dispatch/callback/plugin/rmi/hostname 198.197.24.129 -dispatch/clientside/plugin/rmi/hostname 62.132.140.7


Toget help:
