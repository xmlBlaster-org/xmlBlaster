This is a pretty basic kind of CORBA based chat-application but worth a try.

Compile it (make all) and start it like that:

   jaco javaclients.chat.SimpleChat -name "Nickname"

where "Nickname" should be different for each client you start.
Don´t forget to start the server (jaco org.xmlBlaster.MainGUI) first.

To chat from you multi homed host the another server running xmlBlaster (CORBA):

   java -DOAIAddr=198.197.24.129 javaclients.chat.SimpleChat -name Ben -iorHost 62.132.140.7

   -DOAIAddr is the IP address for our internal chat CORBA callback server.
   -iorHost is the xmlBlaster server,


To chat from you multi homed host the another server running xmlBlaster (XML-RPC):

   java javaclients.chat.SimpleChat -name Tim -client.protocol XML-RPC -xmlrpc.hostnameCB 198.197.24.129 -xmlrpc.hostname 62.132.140.7


To chat from you multi homed host the another server running xmlBlaster (RMI):

   java javaclients.chat.SimpleChat -name RMI -client.protocol RMI -rmi.hostnameCB 198.197.24.129 -rmi.hostname 62.132.140.7
