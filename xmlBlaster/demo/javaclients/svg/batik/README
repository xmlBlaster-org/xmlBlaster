This is a demo on how to use xmlBlaster together with svg clients. It makes 
use of the batik package (see http://xml.apache.org).

The demo is a chess board where you can move around the pieces. 

To run the demo do the following:

1) start xmlBlaster in one term
   > java org.xmlBlaster.Main

2) start another term and change to the directory 
   $XMLBLASTER_HOME/demo/javaclients/svg/batik and invoke
   > java javaclients.svg.batik.ExtendedApplication -svgMaster chess.svg -svgUser user1

   Note: You probably have to adjust the host/port in chess.svg to find xmlBlaster
         It uses "localhost"

3) start another term and change to the same directory as in 2). Invoke
   > java javaclients.svg.batik.ExtendedApplication -svgSlave chess.svg -svgUser user2


enjoy

Some additional notes:

Only svg elements which have an 'id' attribute set which starts with
'xmlBlaster.' are considered to be dynamic. This means that only these elements
are allowed to be moved (by dragging with the mouse).
