This is a demo on how to use xmlBlaster together with svg clients. In this
case the svg clients are en extention to the batik package 
(see http://xml.apache.org).

To run the demo do the following:

1) start xmlBlaster in one term
   > java org.xmlBlaster.Main

2) start another term and change to the directory 
   $XMLBLASTER_HOME/demo/javaclients/svg/batik and invoke
   > java javaclients.svg.batik.ExtendedApplication -svgMaster simple.svg -svgUser user1

3) start another term and change to the same directory as in 2). Invoke
   > java javaclients.svg.batik.ExtendedApplication -svgSlave simple.svg -svgUser user2


enjoy

Some additional notes:

Only svg elements which have an 'id' attribute set which starts with
'xmlBlaster.' are considered to be dynamic. This means that only these elements
are allowed to be moved (by dragging with the mouse).
