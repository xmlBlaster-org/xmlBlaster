		Notes about J2EE connector for XmlBlaster
                =========================================

In here is a resource adapter that follows the J2EE connector
specification. With this it is possible to access XmlBlaster for publishing
from any J2EE runtime environment that supports the Connector spec. One
such runtime that already do that is JBoss (see README.JBoss). The
compiled adapter will be found in lib/xmlBlasterK2.rar.

If you are familiar with EJB you will feel at home. One uses the XmlBlaster
resource adapter the same way you would use a database connectio. You
define it as a resource and look it up with JNDI.

Deployment of the adapter is runtime specific. You will probably have to edit
the META-INF/ra.xml to suit your needs. The possible configurations options
is vissable in the javadoc (or source code) for BlasterManagedConnectionFactory.

The interface to access XmlBlaster is familiar, but you will have to access
it through the interface org.xmlBlaster.j2ee.k2.client.BlasterConnection.

To build the connector you use the ant build script with the argument k2.

There are two examples of how to use the adapter in demo/javaclientent/j2ee/k2.

1. One is a Message Driven Bean with deployment descriptor for JBoss. In it,
and in the deployment descriptors you will find a typical way to use the
adapter.

This you may build with build.sh jms-adapter

2. The other is a standalone TestClient, wich mostly makes it somewhat easier
to debug the adapter and proves that it is spec compliant (an adapter must
support standalone usage).
