Access bean for Windows ActiveX components, 2004-03-09

See
 http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/client.activex.html
 http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/beans/axbridge/developerguide/index.html

With this control you can access xmlBlaster from C#
or VisualBasic which calls a client side java bean
which again connects to the xmlBlaster server.
