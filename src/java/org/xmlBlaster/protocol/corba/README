   - authenticateIdl
     The CORBA interface to login and logout
     All files in this directory are automatically generated.
     AuthServerImpl.java is handcrafted.

   - serverIdl
     The CORBA interface of the xmlBlaster server.
     All files in this directory are automatically generated.
     ServerImpl.java is handcrafted.

   - clientIdl
     The CORBA callback interface for the client (demo)
     All files in this directory are automatically generated.
