NOTE: The code is fully functional but still considered alpha.

This servlet supports a communication with a simple applet.

No classes from xmlBlaster are necessary (only MethodName.java)
to be downloaded by the applet, the overall download size is
approximately 26 kBytes.


o For the applet client library code see 

  xmlBlaster/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/client/protocol/http/applet/README


o For applets example how to use it see

  xmlBlaster/demo/http/applet


o Compile:

  cd xmlBlaster
  build.sh deploy_war
