Marcel 2006-03-25 version 2.7.0

See: http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/

The library is in ../socket/pthreadVC2.dll and pthreadVC2.lib

Changed in pthread.h

#include <sched.h>

to

#include "sched.h"

This way we avoid to set the compiler include additionally to 

  xmlBlaster/src/c/pthreads

on Windows.
