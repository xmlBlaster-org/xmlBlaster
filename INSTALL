Welcome !

We hope these hints are useful to get you running with xmlBlaster.
If  you  have  problems, don't hesitate to contact the maintainers
through the mailing list (see http://www.xmlBlaster.org).

+--------------------+
| REQUIRED           |
+--------------------+

   - JDK 1.4 or 1.5 (until release 1.0.7 additionally JDK 1.2, 1.3)

You need to set JAVA_HOME to point to your
JDK installation, for example:

  export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk	     [Unix sh,ksh,bash]
  export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

  set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program\jdk       [Windows]
  set PATH=%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin


The XmlBlaster distribution comes compiled and ready to go.
Unpack the distribution to some location ($HOME/xmlBlaster is a good spot).


+----------------------------+
| INSTALLATION IN 30 SECONDS |
+----------------------------+

This is for distributions only, if you have checked out with subversion
please go to the next INSTALL section.
We assume you have a proper JDK installation as described above.

Start the server without environment settings:

Change to the installed xmlBlaster directory and type:

  java -jar lib/xmlBlaster.jar

Congratulations, now the server is running and ready!

Type a 'g' if you want the GUI to pop up.
Use -help if you want usage infos.


Now start a client:

  java -classpath lib/xmlBlaster.jar HelloWorld3

You should see some output on your terminal telling
that a message is published and subscribed.

Find out what command line options you have:

  java -classpath lib/xmlBlaster.jar HelloWorld3 -help


To simplify usage, set your CLASSAPATH:

  export CLASSPATH=<pathToXmlBlaster>/lib/xmlBlaster.jar  [UNIX,sh,ksh,bash]

  set CLASSPATH=<pathToXmlBlaster>\lib\xmlBlaster.jar     [Windows]


Please study the files
  HelloWorld.java, HelloWorld2.java, HelloWorld3.java ...
in the directory
  xmlBlaster/demo


To have less overhelming logging output try

  java -jar lib/xmlBlaster.jar -cluster false

or

  java -jar lib/xmlBlaster.jar -cluster.node.id heron


But - if you want to adjust some properties
or develop with xmlBlaster, please read the following section
how to do it.


+----------------------------+
| CONFIGURATION              |
+----------------------------+

It is a good idea to set the environment property XMLBLASTER_HOME
to point to the root directory of the xmlBlaster installation,
for example:

  export XMLBLASTER_HOME=/opt/xmlBlaster  [UNIX sh,ksh,bash]

  set XMLBLASTER_HOME=C:\xmlBlaster       [Windows]


There are three property files which you may want to copy to
your HOME directory:

   a) %HOME%/xmlBlaster.properties
      There is a template %XMLBLASTER_HOME%/config/xmlBlaster.properties.template
      to use as a base.

   b) %HOME%/xmlBlasterPlugins.xml
      There is a template %XMLBLASTER_HOME%/config/xmlBlasterPlugins.xml.template
      to use as a base.

   c) %HOME%/jacorb.properties
      There is a template %XMLBLASTER_HOME%/config/jacorb.properties.template
      to use as a base.
      This file is needed only if you use the CORBA plugin.
      A default setting is included in xmlBlaster.jar which you should remove
      before you play with the %HOME%/jacorb.properties settings.

Note that all three configuration files are in the xmlBlaster.jar file.
xmlBlaster.properties and xmlBlasterPlugins.xml in your HOME directory have
precedence.


+----------------------------+
| PERSISTENCE CONFIGURATION  |
+----------------------------+

XmlBlaster is ready configured to
suppport server crash recovery and huge message
amount to be queued (swapping) with the embedded
database HSQLDB.

However you can choose to use an external database for persistency,
as HSQLDB is not suitable for production use.
Oracle, Postgres, MS-SQLServer and others are supported.
Expect some 20 minutes to setup Postgres to run
with xmlBlaster and some more hours if you decide
to use Oracle.
All configuration is typically done in %HOME%/xmlBlaster.properties

The details are described in
  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.html
  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.postgres.html
  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.oracle.html
  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.sqlserver.html
  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.mysql.html

+-----------------------------------------+
| INSTALLATION FOR DEVELOPERS - USING ANT |
+-----------------------------------------+

If you want to develop with xmlBlaster you can use the
ant build tool.

1. Set JAVA_HOME environment to point to your java installation.

2. Compile xmlBlaster like this (in the xmlBlaster root directory):

   UNIX:       build.sh all

   WINDOWS:    build.bat all

Now you are done.

To see other compilation options (e.g. for C or C++) get the usage with:

   UNIX:       build.sh

   WINDOWS:    build.bat

If you use C or C++ clients you can configure the compiler and support libraries in

   xmlBlaster/build.properties


+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| INSTALLATION FOR DEVELOPERS - USING ECLIPSE www.eclipse.org |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+

To edit and compile with the eclipse framework you need
to generate the CORBA and the SQL92 plugin java code with:

   cd xmlBlaster
   build java-corba-idl javaCup

Now it should be possible to create a xmlBlaster eclipse project.


+--------------------+
| RELATED LINKS      |

The most detailed documentation are the requirements:

  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/requirement.html

You can build the requirement documentation locally with:

  cd ${XMLBLASTER_HOME}
  build.sh requirements  (UNIX)
  build.bat requirements (WINDOWS)
  -> xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/requirement.html

Those requirements files are the primary documentation!

+-------------------------------------+
| START XMLBLASTER AS A CORBA SERVER  |
+-------------------------------------+

You have three options to start the xmlBlaster-Server. The main goal
is how to pass the initial IOR string from the server to the client.

See the ${XMLBLASTER_HOME}/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/README file for more
instructions.

1. A variant using the xmlBlaster built in http server (localhost / 3412 is default)
   (This is the Default-Startup)

     java org.xmlBlaster.MainGUI

   and a testclient
    
     java javaclients.ClientSub



2. A variant using the xmlBlaster built in http server, specify the bootstrap port to listen

     java org.xmlBlaster.MainGUI -bootstrapPort 3412

   and a testclient

     java javaclients.ClientSub -bootstrapHostname localhost -bootstrapPort 3412



3. A variant using a file to pass the server IOR:

     java org.xmlBlaster.MainGUI -plugin/ior/iorFile /tmp/Blaster_Ref

   and a testclient

     java javaclients.ClientSub -plugin/ior/iorFile /tmp/Blaster_Ref


4. Variant using a naming service and corbaloc to find it.

   Edit $HOME/jacorb.properties and set (delete jacorb.properties in xmlBlaster.jar first):

     ORBInitRef.NameService=corbaloc:iiop:localhost:7608/StandardNS/NameServer-POA/_root
     
   start the naming service:

     jaco -DOAPort=7608  org.jacorb.naming.NameServer /tmp/ns.ior

   start xmlBlaster (it will use the port 7608 from jacorb.properties): 

     java -jar lib/xmlBlaster.jar


5. Variant using a naming service and a local web server to publish
   the name service IOR.

   Assuming the document root of your web server is /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/NS_Ref:

     ${JacORB_HOME}/bin/ns  /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/NS_Ref

   Bootstrap port 0 switches the internal http server off:

     java org.xmlBlaster.MainGUI -bootstrapPort 0

   This client looks into jacorb.properties to find the URL with the naming service IOR.
   Edit ${HOME}/jacorb.properties accordingly e.g.

     jacorb.NameServerURL=http://localhost:80/NS_Ref
   
   or without http server:
   
     jacorb.NameServerURL=file:/usr/local/httpd/htdocs/NS_Ref

   Start a client:

     java javaclients.ClientXml -bootstrapPort 0

   If you have problems, check your web server:

     telnet localhost 80
     GET /NS_Ref HTTP/1.0

   you should receive the IOR string, if everything is setup properly and the
   naming service is running.

   Dump an IOR:
      dior `cat /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/NS_Ref`
   
   { OLD stuff:
   List the naming service:
      -DORBInitRef.NameService=corbaname:192.168.78.14:2809
      -DORBInitRef.NameService=corbaloc::eclipse:2809/NameService
      jaco jacorb.naming.ContextLister
      jaco -DORBInitRef.NamingService=corbaloc::160.45.11.41:38693/StandardNS/NameServer%2DPOA/_root
        jacorb.naming.ContextLister

   }

+-----------------------------------+
| START XMLBLASTER AS A RMI SERVER  |
+-----------------------------------+


As a default xmlBlaster start automatically RMI support.
If you want to know more here you go:

1. Check if the driver is loaded in xmlBlasterPlugins.xml and xmlBlaster.properties,
   this example starts the CORBA and the RMI server (RMI driver is active by default):

   $HOME/xmlBlasterPlugins.xml
      <plugin id='IOR' className='org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.CorbaDriver'>
         <action do='LOAD' onStartupRunlevel='3' sequence='2'
                 onFail='resource.configuration.pluginFailed'/>
         <action do='STOP' onShutdownRunlevel='2' sequence='4'/>   
      </plugin>
      <plugin id='RMI' className='org.xmlBlaster.protocol.rmi.RmiDriver'>
         <action do='LOAD' onStartupRunlevel='3' sequence='4' />
         <action do='STOP' onShutdownRunlevel='2' sequence='2'/>   
      </plugin>

   $HOME/xmlBlaster.properties
      CbProtocolPlugin[IOR][1.0]=org.xmlBlaster.protocol.corba.CallbackCorbaDriver
      CbProtocolPlugin[RMI][1.0]=org.xmlBlaster.protocol.rmi.CallbackRmiDriver

2. Adjust the security policy file if you like to (it is currently totaly relaxed):

   xmlBlaster/config/xmlBlaster.policy

3. Start the server:

   java -Djava.security.policy=${XMLBLASTER_HOME}/config/xmlBlaster.policy  org.xmlBlaster.Main

4. And the demo client:

   java -Djava.security.policy=${XMLBLASTER_HOME}/config/xmlBlaster.policy  javaclients.rmi.ClientGet

Note: The java.security.policy setting is optional, xmlBlaster will try
   to find a policy file in your CLASSPATH (there is a default in xmlBlaster.jar)

Note:
   Another variant could be:

     java -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:///${XMLBLASTER_HOME}/classes/
          -Djava.security.policy=${XMLBLASTER_HOME}/config/xmlBlaster.policy
          -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=localhost
          org.xmlBlaster.Main

   Consult the SUN RMI documentation about 'codebase' and 'policy' settings.
   Especially 'codebase' should be used with a web server,
   to test if your code runs in a distributed environment.

     http://archives.java.sun.com/archives/rmi-users.html



+--------------------+
| A DEMO CHAT CLIENT |
+--------------------+

Have a look at xmlBlaster/demo/javaclients/chat/SimpleChat.java
It´s a pretty basic kind of chat-application but worth a try.

Compile it (or use '-cp lib/xmlBlaster.jar') and start it like that:

   java javaclients.chat.SimpleChat -loginName Nickname

where "Nickname" should be different for each client you start.
Don´t forget to start the server (java org.xmlBlaster.Main) first.



+--------------------+
| USING THE TESTSUITE|
+--------------------+

In the directory ${XMLBLASTER_HOME}/testsuite/src/java/org/xmlBlaster you will find
a number of Java based test clients to automatically test xmlBlaster.
   
The xmlBlaster test suite is based on the JUNIT testsuite
from Kent Beck and Erich Gamma, see
   http://www.junit.org/index.htm

There is a GUI based and a command line based variant of the testsuite available.

Please read the
   ${XMLBLASTER_HOME}/testsuite/src/java/org/xmlBlaster/README
file for more informations.

You may also use the provided test clients to study the usage of xmlBlaster.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
See xmlBlaster/demo/perl/xmlrpc/README
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            Perl - Corba client
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perl clients with COPE 0.50_51 (http://www.lunatech.com/research/corba/cope/)
You need MICO first (CORBA access)
-> CORBA is much more complicated, probably you should prefer XmlRpc
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


                         Tcl - Client
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two ways for Tcl clients to access xmlBlaster:

a) Using Tcl clients with TclMico http://www.mico.org/
   tclmico-0.5c.tar.gz

    See directory ${XMLBLASTER_HOME}/testsuite/src/tcl
    for a demo client written in TCL and accessing the xmlBlaster server

b) Using tcljava (TclBlend/JACL) with an ordinary Java client
   This allows scripting of Java with Tcl, and embedding the
   Tcl interpreter (called jacl) into Java code.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


                   orbacus for java and c++
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
xmlBlaster comes with jacorb. If you want to use another corba, some setting 
changes are necessary. XmlBlaster works also with orbacus for java
(JOB-4.0b3 or higher) and orbacus for c++ (OB-4.0b2 or higher). For more
information about orbacus see http://www.ooc.com.
to compile and run xmlBlaster with orbacus do the following:
   
   download orbacus for java and/or orbacus for c++ from http://www.ooc.com.
   compile & install it according to the packages instructions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------



CORBA tuning with jacorb.properties:
------------------------------------
Increasing jacorb.outbuf_size=2048 to 16384 yields 1-5% performance gain

Changing jacorb.reference_caching=off to 'on' does help nothing, +-2%

Increasing jacorb.poa.thread_pool_max=20 to 1000                             
       and jacorb.poa.thread_pool_min=5  to 100  decreases performance 10-40%

Increasing jacorb.poa.queue_max=100 to 1000 does help nothing, +-2%
        but increases stability on heavy load (even higher values
        decrease performance).

Changing jacorb.poa.thread_priority=MAX_PRIORITY (10) to 5 (NORM_PRIORITY)
        does help nothing, +-2%
