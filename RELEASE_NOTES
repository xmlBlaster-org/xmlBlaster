This is xmlBlaster version 2.2.0 2014-06-09 'Piano'


XmlBlaster  is  under development or productive in a huge range
of  industries  like  satellite  control,  air  traffic control
telecommunication,  radar,  car  industry,  process monitoring,
live tracking, mobile phone integration (J2ME), PDA integration
(C#), iPhone integration (Objective C) and more.

This  release  is backward  compatible to the  previous for its
client-server protocols.

It is *NOT* backward compatible for the  database schema of its
persistent queues! Please read below!

The client  Java API  may require   minor  adjustments, but the 
compiler will tell you the places if any (e.g.  added method to
interface class which you could use).

It  is  tested  under Linux/Solaris/Windows/WINCE/MacOSX/iPhone
with  JDK  1.4-1.6  and  g++  2.9x/3.x/4.x, icc 8.x and 9.x and
11.x, MSVisualC++ 2005 and 2008, SunCC compilers (32bit/64bit).
There  is  no  reason  why other platforms/compilers should not
work, just try it.

Persistence is checked against Oracle 9i, 10g and 11, different
Postgres  versions,  MS-SQLServer 2000, 2005 and 2008, Firebird
and hsqldb.

Real-time  database  replication  is  tested  between different
Oracle versions and between Oracle and DB2 (as a sink).

New features include
o Added tunneling of callbacks for the XMLRPC protocol
o New incompatible persistence layer, please read
  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.html
o Other extensions and bug fixes as noted in xmlBlaster/CHANGES

It  is  leak  checked  in  RAM  and  on  persistence  store for
Java,C,C++.

Since release 2.0 we are supporting JDK 1.5 or higher only.

Notes for V2.2.0:
-----------------
Some minor extensions but mainly fixes, see CHANGES file


Notes for V2.1.0:
-----------------
DispatchManager is renamed to I_DispatchManager
please change your code (e.g. in MimeAccessPlugin plugins) if implementing I_ConnectionStatusListener

C++ client library ported to xerces 3.0
Support for sqlite 3.0


Notes for V2.0.0:
-----------------
VERY IMPORTANT CHANGE with xmlBlaster persistence layer, PLEASE READ THIS!
The default configuration now uses the new JdbcQueue database persistence layer with three tables 
  'xbstore', 'xbref', 'xbmeat'.
If you have data in the old schema 'xb_entries' they are NOT used.
In case you need the old data please read
  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/queue.jdbc.html
You can configure xmlBlaster.properties to still use the old database
schema or you need to migrate existing database data (queue entries etc.)
to the new schema!
Old:
  JdbcStorage[XXXXX]=org.xmlBlaster.util.queue.jdbc.JdbcQueueCommonTablePlugin,...
New:
  JdbcStorage[XXXXX]=org.xmlBlaster.util.queue.jdbc.JdbcQueue,...
  

Notes for V1.6.4:
-----------------

The security plugin interface has changed slightly, the compiler
will tell you the place. See CHANGES r16744


Notes for V1.3:
---------------

===========================
Getting login/logout events
===========================
Since  version  1.3, #15211, 2006-06-30 the login/logout events
are deprecated and switched off as default. If you need the old
implementation,  please  activate  it  in xmlBlaster.properties
with
  loginEvent=true
  logoutEvent=true
  userListEvent=true
The new and preferred framework to use is
  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/admin.events.html
The porting is described in
  http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.LoginLogoutEvent.html#workaround

=============================
Incompatible interface change
=============================
 Note  that  the  security plugin interface has changed, if you
 have  coded your own security plugins please adapt them to the
 exended  interface.  The  change is easy and the compiler will
 tell you the place.

Important other extensions:
 -  The  java client library now supports convenience functions
    receive()  and  request().
 -  There  is a C# client using the xmlBlaster  C library
 -  The htpasswd plugin supports now authorization
 -  Race conditions in TopicHandler.java are fixed
 -  Clustering   xmlBlaster   over   email  protocol
 -  Fixed encoding/charset issues



Notes since V1.2:
-----------------
It uses the java.util.logging framework instead of jutils so be
prepared  to  port  your code depending on jutils features. The
engine.Global  class is renamed to engine.ServerScope, you need
to port your native plugins with respect to this rename.


Note:
-----
If   you   use   the   cluster  feature  please  take  the  new
xmlBlaster/config/xmlBlasterPlugins.xml.template     as     the
ClusterManager is now configured as a plugin.


==========
XML Parser
==========
Please comment out the following lines in your old
xmlBlaster.properties as shown
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# JAXP parsers.
#
#javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory=org.apache.crimson.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl
#javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory=org.apache.crimson.jaxp.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or use the new xmlBlaster/config/xmlBlaster.properties.template 
(since 1.0.7 2005-10-26)


============
JDBC service
============
Our  JDBC  service  plugin for xmlBlaster is only available for
JDK 1.5 see
http://www.xmlblaster.org/xmlBlaster/doc/requirements/engine.service.rdbms.html


=============================
IMPORTANT COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
=============================

The JDBC tables have changed incompatible from 0.903 to 0.91.

  -> Removed XB_NODES table (is backward compatible)
  -> Removed XB_QUEUES table (is backward compatible)
  -> Removed column 'nodeId' from XB_ENTRIES (is NOT backward compatible)

     There is now only a single table (PostgreSQL example):

     CREATE TABLE xb_entries (
       dataId bigint,
       queueName text,
       prio integer,
       flag text,
       durable char(1),
       byteSize bigint,
       blob bytea,
       PRIMARY KEY (dataId, queueName)

If you need to upgrade xmlBlaster having legacy data in your database
do manually a

   ALTER TABLE xb_entries DROP COLUMN nodeId'

Otherwise just drop all old database tables
 (for HSQLDB remove its files in the tmp directory, on Windows the
  default %HOMEPATH%\tmp location for user 'joe' is
  "C:\Documents and Settings\joe\tmp"
  and on Linux "$HOME/tmp")

If you forget this the exception text is something like:

   [Aug 28, 2004 2:47:15 PM ERROR XmlBlaster.MainThread org.xmlBlaster.engine.msgstore.cache.PersistenceCachePlugin-topicStore:xmlBlaster_192_168_1_4_3412]
   put: an error occured when writing to the persistent queue, the persistent entry __sys__UserList/2004-08-28 14:47:15.814 will temporarly be handled as transient.
   Is the DB up and running ?
